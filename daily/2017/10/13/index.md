[![Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/manning/getting-mean-second-edition-meap-med.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Simon Holmes. This book covers MEAN, MongoDB 3, Express 4, Angular 2, Node.js 6, Mongoose, REST API, ES2015.

#### Publisher's Description
Traditional web dev stacks use a different programming language in every layer, resulting in a complex mashup of code and frameworks. Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and Angular frameworks, and Node.js constitute the MEAN stack - a powerful platform that uses only one language, top to bottom: JavaScript. Developers and businesses love it because it's scalable and cost-effective. End users love it because the apps created with it are fast and responsive. It's a win-win-win!

Getting MEAN, Second Edition is completely revised and updated to cover Angular 2, Node 6 and the latest mainstream release of JavaScript ES2015 (ES6). This Second Edition will walk you through how to develop web applications using this updated MEAN stack. First, you'll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you'll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you'll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application.

#### What's inside
* Full-stack development using JavaScript
* Responsive web techniques to build mobile-ready web applications
* Everything you need to get started with MEAN
* Best practices for efficiency and reusability

#### About the reader
Readers should have some web development experience. This book is based on MongoDB 3, Express 4, Angular 2, and Node.js 6, making use of the ES2015 JavaScript syntax.

#### About the author
**Simon Holmes** has been a full-stack developer since the late 1990s, manages the European Solutions Engineering team for LivePerson and runs Full Stack Training Ltd.
