[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Crysfel Villa, Stan Bershadskiy with foreword by Christopher Chedeau (valid through 10/21 at 19:00 EST). This book covers React Native, React, JavaScript, Redux, Google Play, Apple App Store, iOS Development, Android Development, Universal Windows Platform, Mac OS X Desktop, Apple tvOS, Appium, Mocha.

#### Publisher's Description
React has taken the web development world by storm, and it is only natural that the unique architecture and its ecosystem of third-party support be applied to native application development. This book will take you through the basics of React Native development all the way through to some more advanced components.

This book covers topics in React Native ranging from adding basic UI components to successfully deploying for multiple target platforms. The book follows a top-down approach beginning with building rich user interfaces. These UIs will be created with both built-in and custom components that you will create, style, and animate.

You will then learn about different strategies for working with data, including leveraging the popular Redux library and optimizing the performance of the application. Then, you will step further into exposing native device functionality. Finally, we will discuss how to put your application into production and maintain its reliability.

#### What You Will Learn
* Build simple and complex UIs using React Native
* Create advanced animations for UI components
* Build universal apps that run on phones and tablets
* Leverage Redux to manage application flow and data
* Expose both custom native UI components and application logic to React Native
* Integrate with existing native applications on iOS and Android
* Deploy your React Native application to the Google Play and Apple App Store
* Add automated testing to your React Native application

[![Enterprise Java Microservices](/assets/img/learning/manning/enterprise-java-microservices-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Ken Finnigan. This book covers Java EE, Microservices, Netflix Hystrix, WildFly Swarm, Java.

#### Publisher's Description
This example-rich tutorial shows how to design and manage large-scale Java applications as a collection of microservices. Starting with an overview of microservices from a Java EE perspective, you'll learn how to refactor your existing applications as microservices and build microservice-based applications from scratch. You'll power through practical tutorials as you call and connect microservices, understand what load balancing is, and use Netflix Hystrix for fault tolerance. You'll also master security and testing, as well as deploying to the cloud.

#### About the technology
Over time, enterprise-grade Java applications can become giant hulking beasts of intertwined code, bloated with third-party libraries, and vulnerable to total collapse when a single part fails. It doesn't have to be that way! Microservices break down a large application into smaller components, each interacting with each other to create a united whole. As each component can start, stop, and scale independently, so the whole system benefits from better fault-tolerance and resilience. Equally-important, separating the application into smaller independent services makes it substantially easier to efficiently manage the development and incremental improvement of your system.

#### What's inside
* The microservices mental model
* Fault tolerance with Netflix Hystrix
* Securing your microservices
* Deploying to the cloud

#### About the reader
This book is for Java developers familiar with distributed n-tier application architecture.

#### About the author

[![Testing Java Microservices](/assets/img/learning/manning/test-java-microservices-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Alex Soto Bueno, Jason Porter, Andy Gumbrecht. This book covers Microservices, Java, Testing, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, End-to-End Testing, JUnit, Java EE, Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm, Docker, Arquillian, Wiremock, Mockito, AssertJ, Pact, Pact-JVM, gatling, Continuous Delivery, ShrinkWrap, Hoverfly, Jenkins.

#### Publisher's Description
With traditional software unit tests, there's never a guarantee that an application will actually function correctly in the production environment. And when you add microservices, remote resources that are accessible over a network, into the mix, testing is more tricky. To make things even harder, microservices typically need to collaborate with additional network-based microservices, making testing even more challenging.

#### About the book
Testing Java Microservices teaches you how to write tests for microservices in Java. You'll learn test strategies that solve the most common issues you are likely to encounter. This practical hands-on guide begins with introducing you to microservices and providing you with a simple, carefully-designed application developed using microservices principles and following some of the most common technologies such as Java EE, Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm, and Docker. You'll move on to write tests for microservices architecture, starting with simple but useful unit tests, all the way to end-to-end tests. The book shows you how to write tests like unit, component, integration, container, contract, chaos, and more. Along the way, you'll also learn about some technologies like the Arquillian ecosystem, Wiremock, Mockito, AssertJ, Pact or Gatling. Finally, you'll see how everything fits together into the Continuous Delivery pipeline.

#### What's inside
* Test automation
* Writing Persistence tests
* Continuous Delivery
* Creating deployable archives with ShrinkWrap
* Testing with Docker

#### About the reader

[![Microservices in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/microservices-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Morgan Bruce, Paulo A. Pereira. This book covers Microservices.

#### Publisher's Description
Microservices in Action is a practical book about building and deploying microservice-based applications. Written for developers and architects with a solid grasp of service-oriented development, it tackles the challenge of putting microservices into production. You'll begin with an in-depth overview of microservice design principles, building on your knowledge of traditional systems. Then, you'll start creating a reliable road to production. You'll explore examples using Kubernetes, Docker, and Google Container Engine as you learn to build clusters and maintain them after deployment. Throughout this rich, experience-driven book, you'll move through real-world use cases including a continuous delivery pipeline, production monitoring, and practical techniques for scaling and maintaining a healthy system.

#### About the technology
Most enterprise developers are comfortable with writing individual components or services as part of a larger application. In microservice systems, the benefits - and unique challenges - arise from the way these services are organized, deployed, and managed. Production-ready microservice applications rely on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, container engines like Docker, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Microservices change the dev process as well, maximizing the efficiency and independence of small teams. To be successful, developers, team leaders, and architects need to master both the implementation details and the big picture of how microservices work in a production environment.

#### What's inside
* Review of microservice architecture
* Building a delivery pipeline for microservices
* Monitoring your microservices applications
* Deploying with containers
* Written by authors with daily, hands-on experience

#### About the reader
Readers should be intermediate developers with some knowledge of enterprise application architecture. Familiarity with container systems like Docker and IaaS cloud like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean is helpful but not required.

#### About the authors
Morgan Bruce and Paulo A. Pereira have years of experience building distributed applications, with particular expertise in the high-stakes finance and identity verification industries. They work daily with microservices in a production environment using the tools and techniques presented in this book.
