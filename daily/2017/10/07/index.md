[![Grokking Bitcoin](/assets/img/learning/manning/grokking-bitcoin.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Kalle Rosenbaum. This book covers Bitcoin, Blockchain, Bitcoin Mining.

#### Publisher's Description
If you think Bitcoin is just an alternative currency for geeks, it's time to think again. Grokking Bitcoin opens up this powerful distributed ledger system, exploring the technology that enables applications both for Bitcoin-based financial transactions and using the blockchain for registering physical property ownership. With this fully illustrated, easy-to-read guide, you'll finally understand how Bitcoin works, how you can use it, and why you can trust the blockchain. You'll discover how to accept and exchange Bitcoin, participate in the Bitcoin network, set up a digital wallet, and even how Bitcoin mining works. Along the way, you'll dive into the underlying security and distributed system concepts that power Bitcoin. Each chapter is loaded with diagrams and exercises to help you gain a true understanding of each interesting topic.

#### About the technology
The modern world turns on universally-accepted ideas of currency and ownership. Bitcoin, and its underlying technology, offer the potential to move control of these key institutions from change-prone governments to a secure storage system that independently records value and ownership in a distributed public ledger called "the blockchain." Data stored on the blockchain is, for all practical purposes, incorruptible; transactions are verified independently and everything is stored in the blockchain, that no single entity controls. In 2009 Bitcoin introduced the blockchain idea in combination with proof-of-work and incentive mechanisms for use as an alternative currency. Today, individuals, businesses, and institutions are using Bitcoin as the foundation for secure blockchain-based transaction systems.

#### What's inside
* Send and receive Bitcoin payments
* Bitcoin transactions
* The blockchain
* Bitcoin mining
* The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network

#### About the reader
This book provides a jargon-free introduction to Bitcoin for any technically interested reader. Some chapters address technical concepts that require basic knowledge of networking and programming.

### <a name="manning-daily-2"></a><small>50% off</small> [Functional Programming in C++](https://www.manning.com/dotd) How to improve your C++ programs using functional techniques
[![Functional Programming in C++](/assets/img/learning/manning/functional-programming-in-cpp.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Ivan Cukic. This book covers C++, Functional Programming, Monads, STL.

#### Publisher's Description
Functional programming is becoming a required skill for all programmers, and for good reason. The functional style of programming lets you write more concise code which tends to have fewer bugs. It allows you to decompose your programs into smaller, highly reusable components, without putting conceptual limits on how the software should be modularized. FP makes software development easier and software more correct and robust. These techniques can be used as a complement to those from other programming paradigms, for example OOP, which makes FP a great fit for C++ as the most popular multi-paradigm language.

#### About the book
Functional Programming in C++ teaches developers the practical side of functional programming and what tools C++ provides to develop software in the functional style. This practical guide starts with an introduction to functional programming that contrasts FP with the imperative style of programming. This book is full of helpful diagrams that help you to understand FP concepts and begin to think functionally. You'll learn, and with the help of lots of code examples, try out FP concepts like monads, lazy evaluation, and immutable data structures. The last few chapters take you deeper into real-world FP, covering functional design for concurrent and distributed systems as well as testing and debugging.

#### What's inside
* Using functional parts of the standard library
* Implementing algorithms without incurring performance penalties
* Creating high-level abstractions for specific domains
* Designing composable component-based systems
* Thinking about program state in a functional way
* Explicitly handling errors through the type system
* Understanding important features in the next C++ standard
* Extending C++ with new control structures
* Implementing DSLs to compose concurrent tasks

#### About the reader
This book is for developers who have worked professionally with C++ for 2 or more years.

#### About the author
**Ivan Cukic** has been teaching modern C++ techniques and functional programming at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade for 6 years and has been using C++ for more than 15 years. He has been researching functional programming in C++ before and during his PhD studies, and uses the techniques in real-world projects. He is one of the core developers in KDE, the largest free/libre open source C++ project.
