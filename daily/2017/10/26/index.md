[![Grokking FRP](/assets/img/learning/manning/grokking-frp-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Timo Tuominen. This book covers Functional Reactive Programming, Reactive Programming, RxJava, Java 8, Android.

#### Publisher's Description
In today's world, user interfaces have to be highly dynamic, asynchronous, and reliable. To meet these demands, the programming world is undergoing a radical shift in thinking about how applications should be designed. This change is called Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), or just Reactive Programming. FRP offers you a new way to construct your application so it responds directly to change. Embracing FRP lets you spend less time tracing obscure problems and more time focusing on what your code should be doing. Changing to an FRP way of thinking can be tough, and that's where this book can help.

Grokking FRP teaches you a new way of thinking about programs and data as well as how to build robust and extensible user interfaces. This well-illustrated book presents lots of concrete, real-world problems and then shows you how FRP helps you solve them. You'll begin by looking at examples that get you into the mindset of data flows. Then this book introduces the concept of a View Model and explains how it can be used as a powerful tool to isolate and unit test any view related business logic without involving the view itself. You'll also learn how FRP enables you to better manage change and introduce new features. The final part of this book focuses on higher-level application design concerns and strategies as you look at architectural approaches and frameworks that work well with FRP thinking.

#### What's inside
* Learn with lots of illustrations and real-life app examples
* Using FRP in your day-to-day programming
* Understand a new way of seeing programs as pipelines of data
* Tackle asynchronous programming with a sustainable approach
* Handing increasing complexity in UIs

#### About the reader
Readers should have a basic understanding of mobile UI development and be familiar with traditional object-oriented programming paradigms.

#### About the author
**Timo Tuominen** has used FRP and RxJava extensively as an architect of a major Android project for Samsung while working with Futurice. As a consultant he has developed dozens of agile projects on almost all relevant platforms - and a number of dead ones - nowadays bringing FRP to wherever he can.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Matt Lacey. This book covers User Experience Design, Usability, Mobile Development, User Interface Design.

#### Publisher's Description
For large groups of users, mobile devices have replaced the desktop as their primary computing platform. As an application developer, you have to think mobile-first to make your customers happy. Mobile apps require a different approach to UI design, and usability matters if you want your apps stand out from the competition! An amazing mobile UX can be the difference between users flocking to your app or causing them to delete it entirely. Fortunately, building great user interfaces is a skill you can learn, even if you're a heads-down desktop or web coder.

Usability Matters: Mobile-first UX for developers and other accidental designers gives you practical advice and guidance creating attractive, elegant, and useful user interfaces for native and web-based mobile apps. You'll start by learning six dimensions of a great app experience. Then you'll be guided through practical concepts for creating those great experiences for your users. Following expertly-presented patterns, examples, and checklists, you'll learn how to recognize good (and not-so-good) UX in your own designs and master the techniques that separate the best apps from the rest of the pack.

#### What's inside
* Understanding your users
* Optimizing user input and output
* Creating fast and responsive experiences
* Coping with poor network conditions

[![Reactive Application Development](/assets/img/learning/manning/reactive-application-development-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Duncan K. DeVore, Sean Walsh, Brian Hanafee. This book covers Reactive Programming, Akka, Scala, Java, Actors, Domain-Driven Design, Typesafe Stack, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Microservices, RESTful APIs, Play, Lagom, Docker.

#### Publisher's Description
Reactive Application Development teaches you how to build reactive applications using the Typesafe stack. The book starts with an architectural overview that teaches you how a reactive application works and shows you where the various technologies you'll use fit into the system. Then you'll tackle the many moving pieces of a reactive application, learning to apply patterns such as CQRS, Event Sourcing, Microservices and more. Along the way, you'll learn how to build distributed domain models for reactive applications and clustered actor systems for elasticity and resilience, as well as how to integrate reactive systems with traditional architectures. You'll also pick up techniques for testing reactive applications, refactoring existing systems, and designing RESTful APIs.

#### About the technology
Modern distributed applications run in environments that may include thousands of processors, web and mobile clients, hybrid cloud deployments, and petabytes of data. The traditional patterns and practices for enterprise application development simply can't deliver the millisecond response times and near-perfect reliability these systems require. Reactive applications meet these demands by employing a loosely-coupled system of independent, isolated components that communicate via asynchronous message passing. These systems are highly responsive to changes in load, extremely fault tolerant through self-healing, and designed to elastically scale. For developers working in JVM-based systems, the Typesafe stack, anchored by the Java and Scala programming languages and the Akka toolkit and runtime, gives developers the tools to build a production-ready reactive application platform.

#### What's inside
* Learn to build production-quality distributed applications that apply reactive design patterns
* Incorporate Actor-based scalable parallelism using Akka
* Design distributed domain models that are elastic
* Build systems that are fault-tolerant and self-healing
* Employ techniques such as CQRS and Event Sourcing to capture behavior
* Efficiently handle large volumes of data and heavy user demand

#### About the reader
Readers should have some familiarity with traditional distributed application architecture and be comfortable reading Java and Scala code. Some familiarity with Akka and functional programming is helpful but not required.

#### About the authors
**Duncan DeVore** works at Typesafe, is a committer on the original event-sourced project that became Akka Persistence, and maintains the Akka Persistence Mongo Plugin. 

**Sean Walsh** is CEO of reactibility.com and a seasoned architect with deep expertise in the Typesafe stack. He consults and evangelizes about reactive architectures. Together, Duncan and Sean deployed one of the first large scale Reactive applications to production. 

**Brian Hanafee** is a Principal Systems Architect at a large financial institution, with experience building reliable and secure web-based applications and backing services for millions of customers.

[![Reactive Programming with RxJS 5](/assets/img/learning/pragmatic/reactive-programming-with-rxjs-5.png)](https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs5/reactive-programming-with-rxjs-5)
[Reactive Programming with RxJS 5](https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs5/reactive-programming-with-rxjs-5) Untangle Your Asynchronous JavaScript Code by Sergi Mansilla. This book covers RxJS 5, JavaScript ES6, Reactive Programming, Node.js, Cycle.js.

#### Publisher's Description
Reactive programming is revolutionary. It makes asynchronous programming clean, intuitive, and robust. Use RxJS 5 to write complex programs in a simple way, and master the Observable: a powerful data type that substitutes callbacks and promises. Think about your programs as streams of data that change and adapt to produce what you want. Manage real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease. Take advantage of Schedulers to make asynchronous testing easier. The code in this new edition is completely updated for RxJS 5 and ES6.

#### About this Title
Create concurrent applications with ease using RxJS 5, a powerful event composition library. Real-world JavaScript applications require you to master asynchronous programming, and chances are that you’ll spend more time coordinating asynchronous events than writing actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools that will greatly simplify the process of writing asynchronous programs.

Find out about Observables, a unifying data type that simplifies concurrent code and eases the pain of callbacks. Learn how Schedulers change the concept of time itself, making asynchronous testing sane again. Find real-world examples for the browser and Node.js along the way: how about a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines of code, or a frantic shoot-’em-up space videogame? You’ll also use Cycle.js—a modern, reactive, web framework—to make a new breed of web applications.

By the end of the book, you’ll know how to think in a reactive way, and how to use RxJS 5 to build complex programs and create amazing reactive user interfaces. You’ll also understand how to integrate it with your existing projects and use it with the frameworks you already know. All the code in this new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated for RxJS 5, ES6, and Cycle.js Unified.
