[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Gastón C. Hillar (valid through 10/05 at 19:00 EST). This book covers REST, Web Services, Python, Django, Flask, Tornado, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy.

#### Publisher's Description
Python is the language of choice for millions of developers worldwide, due to its gentle learning curve as well as its vast applications in day-to-day programming. It serves the purpose of building great web services in the RESTful architecture. This book will show you the best tools you can use to build your own web services.

Learn how to develop RESTful APIs using the popular Python frameworks and all the necessary stacks with Python, Django, Flask, and Tornado, combined with related libraries and tools. We will dive deep into each of these frameworks to build various web services, and will provide use cases and best practices on when to use a particular framework to get the best results.

We will show you everything required to successfully develop RESTful APIs with the four frameworks such as request handling, URL mapping, serialization, validation, authentication, authorization, versioning, ORMs, databases, custom code for models and views, and asynchronous callbacks. At the end of each framework, we will add authentication and security to the RESTful APIs and prepare tests for it.

By the end of the book, you will have a deep understanding of the stacks needed to build RESTful web services.

#### What You Will Learn
* Develop complex RESTful APIs from scratch with Python combined with and without data sources
* Choose the most appropriate (micro) framework based on the specific requirements of a RESTful API / web service

[![Isomorphic Development with JavaScript](/assets/img/learning/manning/isomorphic-development-with-javascript.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Elyse Kolker Gordon. This book covers Isomorphic JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Redux, Webpack, Babel, Express, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
You used to have two options for web app architecture: backend server-rendered in response to requests, or frontend browser-rendered, single page applications. Now you have a new choice: isomorphic apps, which let you take advantage of the best of both worlds. They render the HTML page on the server, deliver rendered markup to the browser, and behave like a single page application in the browser. You get server rendering benefits such as SEO-compatible stacks, fast page loads, improved performance, and the ability to take advantage of caching. And you get single page application advantages including no server interaction after the initial load, common UX patterns like modals, and fast response to user interactions. Node and React make isomorphic apps practical and simpler to build. Now you can write code that runs on the server and the client as well as effectively executing the handoff from the server to the client.

Isomorphic Development with JavaScript teaches web developers to build isomorphic web applications using JavaScript, NodeJS, and React. You'll begin by learning the difference between isomorphic, single page, and server rendered web applications as well as the advantages and challenges of isomorphic web applications. Then you'll get hands-on and build an isomorphic web application. You'll learn how to render views, fetch data with Redux, handle requests on the server, and serialize and deserialize data. This book covers isomorphic app basics, like React, Redux and Webpack. The last part shows you how to apply isomorphic architecture with frameworks like Angular 2 and Ember. By the end, you'll be able to build a high performance content site that will support your users' needs and your SEO goals.

#### What's inside
* Rendering pages with React
* Handling user sessions on both server and the browser
* Using Webpack and Babel for a modern JavaScript workflow
* Combining server rendered and SPA architecture
* Handling real-word caching and performance
* Putting together JavaScript libraries: Redux and React Router
* Debugging and testing in isomorphic environments

#### About the reader
This book is for mid-level web developers with JavaScript experience.

[![React in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/react-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Mark Thomas. This book covers React, Redux, React Native, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
React is an open source JavaScript framework that lets you quickly create user interfaces for web applications. This highly-performant tool implements a one-way data flow model, which means communication is much more top-down than side-to- side. It also utilizes a component-focused design, so you can build large, robust web applications that scale well with users and developers. Reasoning about an interface or application written with React ends up being much easier because it decreases overall complexity for developers working with it. Large and small companies alike are using React for highly-visible, high-impact applications including Facebook.com, Netflix.com, and Airbnb.com.

#### About the book
React in Action introduces front-end developers to the React framework and related tools. This clearly written, example-rich book begins by introducing you to React, diving into some of the fundamental ideas in React, and working with components. You'll work your way from "raw" React (no transpilation, no syntactic helpers) towards JSX, and from basic static components to ones that are dynamic and interactive. In the second section, you'll explore the different ways that data works in React as well as learning more about components. You'll discover core topics like lifecycle methods, data flow, forms, higher-order components, and testing. In the last section, you'll explore React application architecture with Redux, server-side rendering, and even dabble in React Native. You'll also find several useful appendices covering related topics like React tooling and ecosystem.

#### What's inside
* Building a simple social networking sample app (Letters Social)
* Learning about the fundamentals of React
* Dynamically fetching data from a remote JSON API
* Building React applications with modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond)

#### Publisher's Description
The fate of most applications is often sealed before a single line of code has been written. How is that possible? Simply, bad design assures bad results. Good design and effective processes are the foundation on which maintainable applications are built, scaled, and improved. For JavaScript developers, this means discovering the tooling, modern libraries, and architectural patterns that enable those improvements.

JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach introduces techniques to improve software quality and development workflow. You'll begin by learning how to establish processes designed to optimize the quality of your work. You'll execute tasks whenever your code changes, run tests on every commit, and deploy in an automated fashion. Then you'll focus on designing modular components and composing them together to build robust applications.

#### What's inside
* Automated development, testing, and deployment processes
* JavaScript fundamentals and modularity best practices
* Modular, maintainable, and well-tested applications
* Master asynchronous flows, embrace MVC, and design a REST API

#### About the reader
This book assumes readers understand the basics of JavaScript.
