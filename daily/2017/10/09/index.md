[![Raspberry Pi GPU Audio Video Programming](/assets/img/learning/apress/raspberry-pi-gpu-audio-video-programming.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484224717)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484224717) by Jan Newmarch. This book covers Raspberry Pi, Broadcom VideoCore GPU, OpenGL ES, OpenMAX, Dispmanx, OpenVG, GPGPU, EGL, C.

#### Publisher's Description
* A one of a kind book on RPi GPU audio, video and multimedia programming
* Includes a Karaoke machine example
* Author is an expert programmer and teacher of programming

Delve into the Broadcom VideoCore GPU used on the Raspberry Pi and master topics such as OpenGL ES and OpenMAX. Along the way, youâ€™ll also learn some Dispmanx, OpenVG, and GPGPU programming.

The author, Jan Newmarch bumped into a need to do this kind of programming while trying to turn the RPi into a karaoke machine: with the CPU busting its gut rendering MIDI files, there was nothing left for showing images such as karaoke lyrics except for the GPU, and nothing really to tell him how to do it.

Raspberry Pi GPU Audio Video Programming scratches his itch and since he had to learn a lot about RPi GPU programming, he might as well share it with you. What started as a side issue turned into a full-blown project of its own; and this stuff is hard.

#### What You'll Learn
* Use Dispmanx and EGL on Raspberry Pi
* Work with OpenMAX and its components, state, IL Client Library, * * Buffers, and more on RPi
* Process images and video on RPi
* Handle audio on RPi
* Render OpenMAX to OpenGL on the RPi
* Play multimedia files on the RPi
* Use OpenVG for text processing and more
* Master overlays

#### Who This Book Is For
You should be comfortable with C programming and at least some concurrency and thread programming using it.  This book is for experienced programmers who are new or learning about Raspberry Pi.  

#### About the Author
**Jan Newmarch** is Head of ICT (Higher Education) at Box Hill Institute, Adjunct Professor at Canberra University and Adjunct Lecturer in the School of Information Technology, Computing and Mathematics at Charles Sturt University. 

He is interested in more aspects of Computing than he has time to pursue, but the major thrust over the last few years has developed from user interfaces under Unix into Java, the Web and now into general distributed systems. Jan has developed a number of publicly available software systems in these areas. Right now, he is looking at sound for Linux systems and programming the Raspberry Pi's GPU.

[![Functional Programming in JavaScript](/assets/img/learning/manning/functional-programming-in-javascript.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Luis Atencio. This book covers Functional Programming, JavaScript ES6.

#### Publisher's Description
Functional Programming in JavaScript teaches JavaScript developers functional techniques that will improve extensibility, modularity, reusability, testability, and performance. Through concrete examples and jargon-free explanations, this book teaches you how to apply functional programming to real-life development tasks.

About the technology
In complex web applications, the low-level details of your JavaScript code can obscure the workings of the system as a whole. As a coding style, functional programming (FP) promotes loosely coupled relationships among the components of your application, making the big picture easier to design, communicate, and maintain.

#### About the book
Functional Programming in JavaScript teaches you techniques to improve your web applications: their extensibility, modularity, reusability, and testability, as well as their performance. This easy-to-read book uses concrete examples and clear explanations to show you how to use functional programming in real life. If you're new to functional programming, you'll appreciate this guide's many insightful comparisons to imperative or object-oriented programming that help you understand functional design. By the end, you'll think about application design in a fresh new way, and you may even grow to appreciate monads!

#### What's inside
* High-value FP techniques for real-world uses
* Using FP where it makes the most sense
* Separating the logic of your system from implementation details
* FP-style error handling, testing, and debugging

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Aslam Khan. This book covers Functional Programming, Scala, Algorithms, Data Structures.

#### Publisher's Description
Grokking Functional Programming is a practical book. Written especially for object-oriented programmers, it will help you map familiar ideas like objects and inheritance to FP concepts such as programming with immutable data, higher order functions, composing functions, concurrent programming and even the dreaded monad. And you'll be pleased to know that we skip the academic baggage of lambda calculus, category theory, and the mathematical foundations of FP in favor of applying functional programming to everyday programming tasks. At the end of the book, you'll be ready to pick a functional language and start writing useful software.

#### About the technology
Functional programming is more than just writing the same old code in Scala, Clojure, or Haskell. To grok FPâ€”to really get itâ€”you need to rewire your brain to see the world differently. We're here to help you flip the switch. Grokking Functional Programming teaches you first to break down problems in a new way so you can approach them from a FP mindset. Following carefully-selected examples with thorough, carefully-paced explanations, you'll immerse yourself in FP concept by concept. Along the way, exercises, checks for understanding, and even the occasional puzzler give you opportunities to think and practice what you're learning.

#### What's inside
* Designing with functions instead of objects
* Multiple learning approaches to help you grok each new concept
* A practical programming-first teaching style
* Programming with immutable collections
* Writing concurrent programs with a functional style

#### About the reader
Examples use Scala as the teaching language, but this is not a Scala book. No prior knowledge of Scala or FP is required.

#### About the author
**Aslam Khan** is an African software developer whose foray into functional programming was out of necessity, not curiosity. Aslam uses FP daily for production work.
