[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Tim McNamara. This book covers Rust.

#### Publisher's Description
Rust in Action introduces the Rust programming language by exploring numerous systems programming concepts and techniques.You'll be learning Rust by delving into how computers work under the hood. You'll find yourself playing with persistent storage, memory, networking and even tinkering with CPU instructions. The book takes you through using Rust to extend other applications and teaches you tricks to write blindingly fast code. You'll also discover parallel and concurrent programming. Filled to the brim with real-life use-cases and scenarios, you'll go beyond the Rust syntax and see what Rust has to offer in real-world use cases.

#### About the technology
Rust is a new systems programming language that gives you the low-level power of C with the elegance and ease of languages like Ruby and Python. Rust is thread safe, enabling "fearless concurrency". Threads are guaranteed not to overwrite each others' data, but it doesn't impose a garbage collector on you, keeping runtime performance predictable. It incorporates features from functional programming such as higher-order functions that allow for compact, readable programs. Rust is perfect for developers who want to fearlessly explore systems programming with a more ergonomic, less intimidating alternative to C or C++.

#### What's inside
* Portability with Rust
* Concurrent and parallel programming
* Sharing resources with locks or atomic operations
* Avoiding programming with global state
* Message passing inside your applications
* Memory management and garbage collection

#### About the reader
Readers need intermediate programming skills and familiarity with general computer science concepts, the command line, and networking.

#### About the author
**Tim McNamara** is an experienced programmer with a deep interest in natural language processing, text mining, and wider forms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. He is very active in open source communities including the New Zealand Open Source Society.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Anthony Williams. This book covers C++ Concurrency, C++ 17.

#### Publisher's Description
This bestseller has been updated and revised to cover all the latest changes to C++ 14 and 17! C++ Concurrency in Action, Second Edition teaches you everything you need to write robust and elegant multithreaded applications in C++17. You'll discover the basics of starting new threads, how to synchronize operations between threads, designing multithreaded algorithms and data structures, and more. Along the way, you'll learn how to navigate the trickier bits of programming for concurrency while avoiding the common pitfalls.

#### About the technology
C++ may seem like the grandfather of modern programming languages, but this is one spritely old dude! C++ 11 delivered strong support for multithreaded applications, and the subsequent C++14 and 17 updates have built on this baseline. C++ has better options for concurrency than ever before, which means it's an incredibly powerful option for multicore and parallel applications.

#### What's inside
* Managing threads
* Synchronizing concurrent operations
* Designing concurrent code
* Advanced thread management
* Parallel Algorithms
* Debugging multithreaded applications

#### About the reader
Written for C++ programmers who are new to concurrency and others who may have written multithreaded code using other languages, APIs, or platforms.

#### About the author
**Anthony Williams** is a UK-based developer and consultant with many years' experience in C++. He has been an active member of the BSI C++ Standards Panel since 2001, and is the author or co-author of many of the C++ Standards Committee papers that led up to the inclusion of the thread library in the C++11 Standard. He was the maintainer of the Boost Thread library, and is the developer of the just::thread Pro extensions to the C++11 thread library from Just Software Solutions Ltd.

[![Get Programming with Haskell](/assets/img/learning/manning/get-programming-with-haskell.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Will Kurt. This book covers Haskell, Functional Programming, Monads, Lambda Functions.

#### Publisher's Description
Haskell is unlike any other programming language. It's purely functional with a strong type system and lazy evaluation. In practical terms, this means that Haskell treats programs a lot like math, so you have to think more than you type. Along with being arguably the most interesting language, Haskell has the reputation of being one of the most challenging programming languages to learn. Learning Haskell doesn't have to be difficult, and this book can help!

Get Programming with Haskell introduces you to the Haskell language without drowning you in academic jargon and heavy functional programming theory. By working through 43 easy-to-follow lessons, you'll learn Haskell by doing Haskell. This book starts with first concepts, building your knowledge with concrete examples and exercises. You'll learn to think the Haskell way, as you start to understand the language and how to use it effectively. And you'll really appreciate the crystal-clear illustrations, quick-checks, and open-ended tasks that make sure you're solid on each new concept before you move along!

#### What's inside
* Learn the foundations of Functional Programming
* Write safe, predictable code with fewer bugs
* Thinking in types to solve problems
* Understanding Haskell's unique features
* Use Monads to solve practical problems

#### About the reader
Readers should have some experience with JavaScript, Python or Ruby. No functional programming or math skills required.

#### About the author
Will Kurt currently works as a Data Scientist at Quick Sprout. With a formal background in both Computer Science (MS) and English Literature (BA) he is fascinated with explaining complex technical topics as clearly and generally as possible. He has taught a course section on Haskell at the University of Nevada, Reno and given workshops on Functional Programming. He also blogs about probability at [CountBayesie.com](https://www.countbayesie.com/).

[React in Motion](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/react-in-motion)  by Zac Braddy. This book covers React, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
React.js is a game-changer. This powerful web framework reinvents the way you create web UI, making it possible to build responsive browser-based applications with flowing, flicker-free screens. The React in Motion liveVideo course gets you up and running with React just as smoothly. As you work through the efficient crystal-clear tutorials from experienced React developer Zac Braddy, you'll learn the ins and outs of React development, essential techniques for working with reactive applications, and handy code reuse techniques that will save you time and effort! 

In this liveVideo, you'll start with the fundamentals of React, as you build your first application. You'll learn how to set up the perfect build environment, build your own components, make asynchronous calls to third party APIs, efficiently test, debug, and then finally deploy your finished reactive applications!

#### About the subject
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for creating clean web UI in applications where data and graphics change frequently. React is more lightweight than similar frameworks like Angular and Ember because React only handles the view —the visible portion of the application. React partners with a rich ecosystem of technologies that you can mix and match to build a full stack tailored to your specific needs. React is a high-demand skill, so there's no better time to get started!

#### Prerequisites
Designed for front-end and full-stack web developers with a basic understanding of ES6 JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Knowledge of promises in JS and Virtual DOM is helpful, but not required.

#### What you will learn
* The fundamentals and best practices for working with React
* Setting up the perfect build environment for your React projects
* Constructing components and basic patterns
* Making asynchronous calls to third party APIs
* Building your first React application

#### About the instructor
**Zac Braddy** is a full stack developer whose career has seen him working with almost every tech you can think of. He has blogged extensively about React and maintains a popular YouTube channel on React.
