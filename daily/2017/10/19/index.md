#### Publisher's Description
Rx.NET in Action teaches developers how to build event-driven applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library.

#### About the technology
Modern applications must react to streams of data such as user and system events, internal messages, and sensor input. Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a .NET library containing more than 600 operators that you can compose together to build reactive client- and server-side applications to handle events asynchronously in a way that maximizes responsiveness, resiliency, and elasticity.

#### About the book
Rx.NET in Action teaches developers how to build event-driven applications using the Rx library. Starting with an overview of the design and architecture of Rx-based reactive applications, you'll get hands-on with in-depth code examples to discover firsthand how to exploit the rich query capabilities that Rx provides and the Rx concurrency model that allows you to control both the asynchronicity of your code and the processing of event handlers. You'll also learn about consuming event streams, using schedulers to manage time, and working with Rx operators to filter, transform, and group events.

#### What's inside
* Introduction to Rx in C#
* Creating and consuming streams of data and events
* Building complex queries on event streams
* Error handling and testing Rx code

#### About the reader

[![Grokking FRP](/assets/img/learning/manning/grokking-frp-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Timo Tuominen. This book covers Functional Reactive Programming, Reactive Programming, RxJava, Java 8, Android.

#### Publisher's Description
In today's world, user interfaces have to be highly dynamic, asynchronous, and reliable. To meet these demands, the programming world is undergoing a radical shift in thinking about how applications should be designed. This change is called Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), or just Reactive Programming. FRP offers you a new way to construct your application so it responds directly to change. Embracing FRP lets you spend less time tracing obscure problems and more time focusing on what your code should be doing. Changing to an FRP way of thinking can be tough, and that's where this book can help.

Grokking FRP teaches you a new way of thinking about programs and data as well as how to build robust and extensible user interfaces. This well-illustrated book presents lots of concrete, real-world problems and then shows you how FRP helps you solve them. You'll begin by looking at examples that get you into the mindset of data flows. Then this book introduces the concept of a View Model and explains how it can be used as a powerful tool to isolate and unit test any view related business logic without involving the view itself. You'll also learn how FRP enables you to better manage change and introduce new features. The final part of this book focuses on higher-level application design concerns and strategies as you look at architectural approaches and frameworks that work well with FRP thinking.

#### What's inside
* Learn with lots of illustrations and real-life app examples
* Using FRP in your day-to-day programming
* Understand a new way of seeing programs as pipelines of data
* Tackle asynchronous programming with a sustainable approach
* Handing increasing complexity in UIs

#### About the reader
Readers should have a basic understanding of mobile UI development and be familiar with traditional object-oriented programming paradigms.

#### About the author
**Timo Tuominen** has used FRP and RxJava extensively as an architect of a major Android project for Samsung while working with Futurice. As a consultant he has developed dozens of agile projects on almost all relevant platforms - and a number of dead ones - nowadays bringing FRP to wherever he can.

[![Grokking ReactiveX](/assets/img/learning/manning/grokking-reactivex-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Ivan Morgillo, Sasa Sekulic, Fabrizio Chignoli. This book covers ReactiveX, Reactive Programming.

#### Publisher's Description
The basic idea behind reactive programming is simple. Things change, you observe them, and you react when the change happens. And change happens all the time. Everything around us is a source of information, everything moves, everything updates constantly. The problem is that we need to know when things happens, instead of continuously checking to see if everything is still the same. When you think in a reactive way, you begin to imagine the data as a continuous flow of information: temperature value emitted by a sensor, a new record on a database, an updated figure in a spreadsheet. You aren't asking for data, you just subscribe to the change and react when it happens. ReactiveX is the common tongue of the reactive programming world. It's a new programming paradigm you can apply to infinite scenarios using any popular programming language. To grok ReactiveX "to really get it" you need to rewire your brain to see the world differently, and we're here to help you.

#### About the book
Grokking ReactiveX is a practical book that teaches you to solve complex problems elegantly and with few lines of code. You'll begin with an overview of reactive programming principles along with the key concepts of ReactiveX such as observables, observers, and subscriptions. Then the book goes in to more depth on the observable/observer relationship, and how schedulers approach multi-threading and concurrency. To make learning easier, each chapter introduces a new concept and then immediately shows you how to use it. You'll begin to break down problems in a new way so you can approach them from a reactive mindset. Following carefully-selected examples with thorough, well-paced explanations, you'll immerse yourself in ReactiveX, concept by concept. Along the way, exercises, checks for understanding, and even the occasional puzzler give you opportunities to think and practice what you're learning.

#### What's inside
* Using ReactiveX in real-world projects
* Multiple learning approaches to help you grok each new concept
* A practical programming-first teaching style
* Think reactively from start to finish
* Use and debug multithreaded systems
* Programming with immutable collections
* Building flexible, loosely-coupled, and scalable systems
* Reacting to failures instead of just handling them

#### About the reader
This book is for developers who are familiar with object oriented design patterns and can read Java or C# code.

#### About the authors
**Ivan Morgillo**, author of RxJava Essentials, Senior Android Developer, Node.js developer and embedded systems enthusiast, uses Rx everywhere, no matter the language or how small the CPU!

**Fabrizio Chignoli** is a software developer for backend systems on Microsoft platforms, who discovered Rx when it was on its very early stages, and fell in love with the philosophy underneath. He has used it for solving countless problems that would have required much more code with conventional programming.

**Sasa Sekulic** is a senior Android developer and co-founder of Alter Ego Solutions. He was bitten by the Rx bug in 2013 and has used it in all his projects since, vowing to never write another AsyncTask again.

This book covers Complex Network Analysis, Python, NetworkX, Gephi, NetworKit, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, python-louvain.

#### Publisher's Description
Construct, analyze, and visualize networks with networkx, a Python language module. Network analysis is a powerful tool you can apply to a multitude of datasets and situations. Discover how to work with all kinds of networks, including social, product, temporal, spatial, and semantic networks. Convert almost any real-world data into a complex network—such as recommendations on co-using cosmetic products, muddy hedge fund connections, and online friendships. Analyze and visualize the network, and make business decisions based on your analysis. If you’re a curious Python programmer, a data scientist, or a CNA specialist interested in mechanizing mundane tasks, you’ll increase your productivity exponentially.

#### About this Title
Complex network analysis used to be done by hand or with non-programmable network analysis tools, but not anymore! You can now automate and program these tasks in Python. Complex networks are collections of connected items, words, concepts, or people. By exploring their structure and individual elements, we can learn about their meaning, evolution, and resilience.

Starting with simple networks, convert real-life and synthetic network graphs into networkx data structures. Look at more sophisticated networks and learn more powerful machinery to handle centrality calculation, blockmodeling, and clique and community detection. Get familiar with presentation-quality network visualization tools, both programmable and interactive—such as Gephi, a CNA explorer. Adapt the patterns from the case studies to your problems. Explore big networks with NetworKit, a high-performance networkx substitute. Each part in the book gives you an overview of a class of networks, includes a practical study of networkx functions and techniques, and concludes with case studies from various fields, including social networking, anthropology, marketing, and sports analytics.

Combine your CNA and Python programming skills to become a better network analyst, a more accomplished data scientist, and a more versatile programmer.

#### About the Author
**Aditya Ravi Shankar** started programming in 1993 when he was first introduced to the world of computers. With no access to the Internet or online tutorials at the time, he wrote his first game in GW-BASIC by painstakingly retyping code from a book he found at the local library.

After graduating from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2001, he spent nearly a decade working as a software consultant, developing trading and analytics systems for investment banks and large Fortune 100 companies, before eventually leaving his corporate life behind so he could focus on doing what he loved.

A self-confessed technology geek, he has spent the time since then working on his own projects and experimenting with every new language and technology that he could, including of course HTML5. During this time he became well known for singlehandedly re-creating the famous RTS game Command and Conquer, as well as Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines entirely in HTML5.

Apart from programming, Aditya is passionate about billiards, salsa dancing, fitness and personal development. He maintains a personal website where he writes articles on game programming, personal development, and billiards, as well as shares his popular game demos.

When he is not busy writing or working on his own projects, Aditya does consulting work with companies to help them launch new software products and games.
