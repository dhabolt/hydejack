[![Scala High Performance Programming](/assets/img/learning/packt/scala-high-performance-programming.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Vincent Theron, Michael Diamant (valid through 10/30 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Scala, Functional Programming, Flight Recorder, Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, Free Monad, Event Sourcing.

#### Publisher's Description
**Leverage Scala and the functional paradigm to build performant software**

Scala is a statically and strongly typed language that blends functional and object-oriented paradigms. It has experienced growing popularity as an appealing and pragmatic choice to write production-ready software in the functional paradigm. Scala and the functional programming paradigm enable you to solve problems with less code and lower maintenance costs than the alternatives. However, these gains can come at the cost of performance if you are not careful.

Scala High Performance Programming arms you with the knowledge you need to create performant Scala applications. Starting with the basics of understanding how to define performance, we explore Scala's language features and functional programming techniques while keeping a close eye on performance throughout all the topics.

We introduce you as the newest software engineer at a fictitious financial trading company, named MV Trading. As you learn new techniques and approaches to reduce latency and improve throughput, you'll apply them to MV Trading’s business problems. By the end of the book, you will be well prepared to write production-ready, performant Scala software using the functional paradigm to solve real-world problems.

#### What You Will Learn
* Analyze the performance of JVM applications by developing JMH benchmarks and profiling with Flight Recorder
* Discover use cases and performance tradeoffs of Scala language features, and eager and lazy collections
* Explore event sourcing to improve performance while working with stream processing pipelines
* Dive into asynchronous programming to extract performance on multicore systems using Scala Future and Scalaz Task
* Design distributed systems with conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to take advantage of eventual consistency without synchronization
* Understand the impact of queues on system performance and apply the Free monad to build systems robust to high levels of throughput

#### About the Authors

#### About the Authors
**Dennis Matotek** is Senior Development Operations Engineer at Envato, an online digital marketplace where a community of creatives can help bring ideas to life. He helps a small team of engineers deploy code, build infrastructure, and monitor performance to varying different systems; mostly written in Rails. He mostly works with AWS rather than bare metal and appreciates not having to change failed disks.

He lives in Melbourne, Australia with his partner and two children.

**James Turnbull** manages the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at the National Australia Bank. He is also a member of Linux Australia, which included sitting on the Executive Council in 2008, and on the committee of Linux Users of Victoria.

He is a contributor to a number of open source projects and regularly speaks on topics related to writing, systems administration, and open source technologies. He is the author of three books, Pulling Strings with Puppet: Systems Administration Made Easy (Apress, 2008), Hardening Linux (Apress, 2008), and Pro Nagios 2.0 (Apress, 2006).

**Peter Lieverdink** was born in a small Dutch country town. He owns a pair of clogs, but has never eaten tulips or lived in a windmill. On his 22nd birthday, Peter moved to Australia and briefly worked in an office cubicle. He now runs his own business, Creative Contingencies Pty, Ltd. The business depends on open source software for infrastructure and development as well as daily office tasks. 

Peter specializes in web application development and helping other businesses implement open source solutions using Linux on both desktops and servers.
