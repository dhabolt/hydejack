#### Publisher's Description
AI and Deep Learning are transforming the way we understand software, making computers more intelligent than we could even imagine just a decade ago. Deep Learning algorithms are being used across a broad range of industries – as the fundamental driver of AI, being able to tackle Deep Learning is going to a vital and valuable skill not only within the tech world but also for the wider global economy that depends upon knowledge and insight for growth and success. It’s something that’s moving beyond the realm of data science – if you’re a Java developer, this book gives you a great opportunity to expand your skillset.

Starting with an introduction to basic machine learning algorithms, to give you a solid foundation, Deep Learning with Java takes you further into this vital world of stunning predictive insights and remarkable machine intelligence. Once you’ve got to grips with the fundamental mathematical principles, you’ll start exploring neural networks and identify how to tackle challenges in large networks using advanced algorithms. You will learn how to use the DL4J library and apply Deep Learning to a range of real-world use cases.

[![The Agile Enterprise](/assets/img/learning/apress/the-agile-enterprise.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484223901)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484223901) by Mario E. Moreira. This book covers Agile.

#### Publisher's Description
* Shows how to engineer idea pipelines to feed an organization’s work portfolio most quickly and productively
* Teaches how to leverage agile practices such as value stream mapping, Lean Canvas, personas, story mapping, and Cost of Delay metrics to deliver optimum value to customers
* Demonstrates how to subordinate processes and tools to the delivery of value to the enterprise

Discover how to implement and operate in an Agile manner at every level of your enterprise and at every point from idea to delivery. Learn how Agile-mature organizations adapt nimbly to microchanges in market conditions. Learn cutting-edge practices and concepts as you extend your implementation of Agile through the entire enterprise to meet customer needs.

Veteran Agile coach Mario Moreira argues that two critical conditions must be conscientiously cultivated at a company before it can expect to reap in full measure the business benefits of mature Agile. First, individuals at every level must be committed to the mindset and the implementation of practices rigorously focused on delivering value to the customer. Second, all employees must be empowered to take ownership. This holistic transformation wrenches the status quo and provokes a strong focus where customers and employees matter.

#### What You'll Learn
* Establish an idea pipeline to quickly and productively evolve customer value through all levels of the enterprise
* Incorporate a discovery mindset—experimental, incremental, design, and divergent thinking—and fast feedback loops to increase the odds that what you build aligns more closely to what customer wants
* Leverage Lean Canvas, personas, story mapping, value stream mapping, Cost of Delay, servant leadership, self-organization, and more to deliver optimum value to customers
* Use continuous agile budgeting and idea pipelines at the senior levels of the enterprise to enable you to adapt to the speed of the market
* Reinvent human resources, portfolio management, finance, and many areas of management toward new roles in the enablement of customer value
* Map a top-to-bottom and end-to-end holistic view of your Agile galaxy to gauge where you are today and where you’d like to go in your Agile future
* Be truly Agile throughout your enterprise, focused on customer value and employees above all else

#### Who This Book Is For
Executives and senior management; sponsors of Agile within a company; ScrumMasters and Agile coaches, champions, and consultants; project management and quality assurance officers (PMOs and AMOs); portfolio managers; product managers and product owners; marketing and business managers; functional, middle, and resource managers; engineering heads and managers; cross-functional engineering/scrum teams; and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
