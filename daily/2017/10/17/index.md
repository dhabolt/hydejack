#### Publisher's Description
See it. Do it. Learn it! Keras in Motion introduces you to the amazing Keras deep learning library through high-quality video-based lessons and built-in exercises, so you can put what you learn into practice.

Keras in Motion teaches you to build neural-network models for real-world data problems using Python and Keras. In over two hours of hands-on, practical video lessons, you'll apply Keras to common machine learning scenarios, ranging from regression and classification to implementing Autoencoders and applying transfer learning. In each crystal-clear video module, you'll put your new knowledge into practice, as you teach your network to recognize text and even create an algorithm for a self-driving car!

#### About the subject
Keras is a Python library designed to take the stress out of deep learning. The Keras library provides a library of high-level building blocks on top of the low-level features of the TensorFlow and Theano machine learning frameworks. In Keras, you define deep learning models without specifying the detailed mathematics and other mechanics, so you can focus on what you want to accomplish. Built with experimentation and prototyping in mind, Keras has a super friendly API and an intuitive Python-based coding style. With over 50,000 users, Keras is the perfect choice for any developer working with data.

#### Prerequisites
Written for intermediate-level data scientists, developers, and machine learning engineers. Code examples are in Python.

#### What you will learn
* Regression and classification problems
* Using neural networks for image processing
* Building autoencoders
* Designing and implementing a self-driving car
* Hands-on coding with practical exercises and example

#### About the instructor
**Dan Van Boxel** is an engineer and data scientist with a background in both engineering and mathematics. On his livestream, Dan demonstrates a different machine learning library, method, or model weekly.

[![Deep Learning with Python](/assets/img/learning/manning/deep-learning-with-python-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Francois Chollet. This book covers Keras, Deep Learning, Python, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.

#### Publisher's Description
Deep learning is applicable to a widening range of artificial intelligence problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, text classification, question answering, text-to-speech, and optical character recognition. It is the technology behind photo tagging systems at Facebook and Google, self-driving cars, speech recognition systems on your smartphone, and much more.

In particular, Deep learning excels at solving machine perception problems: understanding the content of image data, video data, or sound data. Here's a simple example: say you have a large collection of images, and that you want tags associated with each image, for example, "dog," "cat," etc. Deep learning can allow you to create a system that understands how to map such tags to images, learning only from examples. This system can then be applied to new images, automating the task of photo tagging. A deep learning model only has to be fed examples of a task to start generating useful results on new data.

#### About the technology
Keras is one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for Python. Keras puts ease of use and accessibility front and center, making it a great fit for getting started with deep learning. Besides being easy to work with, it is suitable for the most advanced use cases as well: almost all deep learning competitions on Kaggle.com are won using Keras code.

#### About the book
Deep Learning with Python is for developers with some Python experience who want to learn how to use deep learning to solve real-world problems. The book is structured around a series of practical code examples that illustrate each new concept introduced and demonstrate best practices. You begin by finding out what deep learning is, and how it connects with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as well as why deep learning is rapidly gaining in importance right now. You will then learn the fundamentals of machine learning, and finally, you will dive deeper into practical applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and more. By the time you reach the end of this book, you will have become a Keras expert and will be able to apply deep learning in your own projects.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Andrew W. Trask. This book covers Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Python, Gradient Descent, MNIST, Natural Language Processing.

#### Publisher's Description
Artificial Intelligence is one of the most exciting technologies of the century, and Deep Learning is in many ways the "brain" behind some of the world's smartest Artificial Intelligence systems out there. Loosely based on neuron behavior inside of human brains, these systems are rapidly catching up with the intelligence of their human creators, defeating the world champion Go player, achieving superhuman performance on video games, driving cars, translating languages, and sometimes even helping law enforcement fight crime. Deep Learning is a revolution that is changing every industry across the globe.

Grokking Deep Learning is the perfect place to begin your deep learning journey. Rather than just learn the "black box" API of some library or framework, you will actually understand how to build these algorithms completely from scratch. You will understand how Deep Learning is able to learn at levels greater than humans. You will be able to understand the "brain" behind state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, unlike other courses that assume advanced knowledge of Calculus and leverage complex mathematical notation, if you're a Python hacker who passed high-school algebra, you're ready to go. And at the end, you'll even build an A.I. that will learn to defeat you in a classic Atari game.
