The most popular ones are movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.

The book starts with an introduction to recommendation systems and its applications. You will then start building recommendation engines straight away from the very basics. As you move along, you will learn to build recommender systems with popular frameworks such as R, Python, Spark, Neo4j, and Hadoop. You will get an insight into the pros and cons of each recommendation engine and when to use which recommendation to ensure each pick is the one that suits you the best.

During the course of the book, you will create simple recommendation engine, real-time recommendation engine, scalable recommendation engine, and more. You will familiarize yourselves with various techniques of recommender systems such as collaborative, content-based, and cross-recommendations before getting to know the best practices of building a recommender system towards the end of the book!

### <a name="new1"></a>[Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudiajs)
[![Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js](/assets/img/learning/manning/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudia-js-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudiajs)
[Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudiajs)  by Slobodan Stojanovic, Aleksandar Simovic. This book covers Node.js, Claudia.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Microservices, Amazon Alexa.

#### Publisher's Description
First the buzzwords: Serverless computing. AWS Lambda. API Gateway. Node.js. Microservices. Cloud-hosted functions. That's an impressive-sounding list, but what's the point? Beyond the buzzwords are real benefits like fast design-to-deployment times, low hosting costs, and efficient scaling and application management, along with real technologies that deliver them.

Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js walks you through building serverless apps on AWS using JavaScript. Inside, you'll create a full project designed to help you understand and apply general serverless design principles and concepts. Along the way, you'll also discover what Claudia brings to the table as you build and deploy a scalable event-based serverless application that is fully integrated with AWS services including Lambda and API Gateway. You'll learn to simplify the design and development process so you can focus on getting your application deployed as fast as possible without sacrificing quality. Plus, you'll learn how to migrate your existing Express apps to serverless!

#### About the technology
Serverless computing services like AWS Lambda and API Gateway can be tedious to set up, aren't designed to work well with JavaScript and Node, and most of the quirks and gotchas aren't well documented. A new generation of serverless tools, including Claudia.js, make it radically easier to set up serverless web applications so you can focus on what your app does instead of meddling with infrastructure configuration and deployment. Claudia doesn't alter your project layout or abstract away the core AWS services; it just makes it easier to get started with them!

#### What's inside
* Creating a serverless API using AWS Lambda and Claudia.js
* Doing authentication and database storage in a serverless way
* Creating a chatbot for multiple platforms
* Building a voice assistant with Amazon Alexa
* Developing microservices with Node.js, AWS Lambda, S3, and more

#### About the reader
Written for beginner and intermediate web developers comfortable with JavaScript and Node.js. Some prior experience with AWS is required.

#### About the authors
**Slobodan Stojanovic** and **Aleksandar Simovicv** are core contributors to the Claudia.js project and are the lead developers and maintainers of Claudia Bot Builder. They work closely with Claudia.js founder Gojko Adžic, and present serverless and Claudia.js at conferences and workshops.
