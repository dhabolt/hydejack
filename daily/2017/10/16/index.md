[![Natural Language Processing in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/natural-language-processing-in-action.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Hobson Lane, Hannes Hapke, Cole Howard. This book covers Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Chatbot, Neural Networks, Word2vec, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Networks.

#### Publisher's Description
Natural Language Processing in Action is your guide to creating machines that understand human language. You'll start with a mental model of how a computer learns to read and interpret language. Then, you'll discover how to train a NLP machine to recognize patterns and extract information from text. As you explore the carefully-chosen examples, you'll expand your machine's knowledge and apply it to a range of challenges, from building a search engine that can find documents based on their meaning rather than merely keywords, to training a chatbot that uses deep learning to answer questions and participate in a conversation.

#### About the technology
Most humans are pretty good at reading and interpreting text; computers...not so much. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the discipline of teaching computers to read more like people, and you see examples of it in everything from chatbots to the speech-recognition software on your phone. Modern NLP techniques based on machine learning radically improve the ability of software to recognize patterns, use context to infer meaning, and accurately discern intent from poorly-structured text. NLP promises to help you improve customer interactions, save cost, and reinvent text-intensive applications like search or product support.

#### What's inside
* Parsing and normalizing text
* Rule-based (Grammar) NLP
* Data-based (Machine Learning) NLP
* Deep Learning NLP
* End-to-end chatbot pipeline with training data
* Scalable NLP pipelines
* Hyperparameter optimization algorithms

#### About the reader
A basic understanding of machine learning and some experience with a modern programming language such as Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript will be helpful.

#### About the authors

[![Reactive Machine Learning Systems](/assets/img/learning/manning/reactive-machine-learning-systems.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jeff Smith. This book covers Machine Learning, Reactive Design, Scala, Spark, MLlib, Akka, Big Data, Functional Programming, Microservices, Bayesian Modeling, Naive Bayes.

#### Publisher's Description
Reactive Machine Learning Systems teaches you how to implement reactive design solutions in your machine learning systems to make them as reliable as a well-built web app. This example-rich guide starts with an overview of machine learning systems while focusing on where reactive design fits. Then you'll discover how to develop design patterns to implement and coordinate ML subsystems. Using Scala and powerful frameworks such as Spark, MLlib, and Akka, you'll learn to quickly and reliably move from a single machine to a massive cluster. Finally, you'll see how you can operate a large-scale machine learning system over time. By the end, you'll be employing the principles of reactive systems design to build machine learning applications that are responsive, resilient, and elastic.

#### About the technology
Machine learning applications autonomously reason about data at massive scale. It's important that they remain responsive in the face of failure and changes in load. And the best way to to keep applications responsive, resilient, and elastic is to incorporate reactive design. But machine learning systems are different than other applications when it comes to testing, building, deploying, and monitoring. They also have unique challenges when you need to change the semantics or architecture of the system. To make machine learning systems reactive, you need to understand both reactive design patterns and modern data architecture patterns.

#### What's inside
* Functional programming for distributed systems
* Reactive techniques like futures, actors, and supervision
* Spark and MLlib, and Akka
* Scala-based examples
* Predictive microservices
* Data models for uncertain data
* Design patterns for machine learning systems

#### About the reader
Readers should have intermediate skills in Java or Scala. No previous machine learning experience is required.

#### About the author
**Jeff Smith** builds large-scale machine learning systems using Scala and Spark. For the past decade, he has been working on data science applications at various startups in New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. He blogs and speaks about various aspects of building real world machine learning systems.
