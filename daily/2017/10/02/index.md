[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Julien Vehent. This book covers DevOps, Security, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, IaaS.

#### Publisher's Description
Modern DevOps make it possible to run online services at low cost, and let small startups compete with tech giants. The role of the security team in DevOps organizations is to be the safety net that protects the company's assets while allowing it to succeed. Securing DevOps is about helping organizations operate securely and protect the data their customers entrust to them. Security teams need to adopt the techniques of DevOps and switch their focus from defending only the infrastructure to protecting the entire organization by improving it continuously.

#### About the book
Securing DevOps explores how the techniques of DevOps and Security should be applied together to make cloud services safer. This introductory book reviews state of the art practices used in securing web applications and their infrastructure, and teaches you techniques to integrate security directly into your product. You'll also learn the core concepts of DevOps, such as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure as a Service. You'll build an example service - an invoice management API - as you learn how to implement both DevOps and Security concepts together. By the end of this book, you'll be ready to build security controls at all layers, monitor and respond to attacks on cloud services, and add security organization-wide through risk management and training.

#### What's inside
* The DevOps approach to Continuous Security
* Construction of a DevOps pipeline via an example application
* Implementation of Test Driven Security at the web application, cloud infrastructure, and delivery pipeline layers
* Common attacks on cloud services and methods to protect against them
* Techniques used in intrusion and fraud detection, digital forensics, and incident response
