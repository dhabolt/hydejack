#### Publisher's Description
We're living in a big data world. Being able to make near-real-time decisions becomes increasingly crucial. To succeed, we need machine learning systems that can turn massive amounts of data into valuable insights. But when you're just starting out in the data science field, how do you get started creating machine learning applications? The answer is TensorFlow, a new open source machine learning library from Google that they use in their own successful products like Search, Maps, YouTube, Translate, and Photos. The TensorFlow library can take your high level designs and turn them into the low level mathematical operations required by machine learning algorithms.

#### About the technology
Machine Learning with TensorFlow teaches you machine learning algorithms and how to implement solutions with TensorFlow. You'll start with an overview of machine learning concepts. Next, you'll learn the essentials you'll need to begin using TensorFlow before moving on to specific machine learning problems and solutions. With lots of diagrams, code examples, and exercises, this tutorial teaches you cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve them. Each chapter zooms into a prominent example of machine learning, such as classification, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and neural networks. Cover them all to master the basics, or cater to your needs by skipping around. By the end of this book, you'll be able to solve classification, clustering, regression, and prediction problems in the real world.

Machine Learning in Action is unique book that blends the foundational theories of machine learning with the practical realities of building tools for everyday data analysis. You'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.

#### About the book
A machine is said to learn when its performance improves with experience. Learning requires algorithms and programs that capture data and ferret out the interesting or useful patterns. Once the specialized domain of analysts and mathematicians, machine learning is becoming a skill needed by many.

Machine Learning in Action is a clearly written tutorial for developers. It avoids academic language and takes you straight to the techniques you'll use in your day-to-day work. Many (Python) examples present the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization in code you can reuse. You'll understand the concepts and how they fit in with tactical tasks like classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.

Readers need no prior experience with machine learning or statistical processing. Familiarity with Python is helpful.

#### What's inside
* A no-nonsense introduction
* Examples showing common ML tasks
