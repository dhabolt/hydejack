[![Angular Development with Typescript, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/manning/angular-development-with-typescript-second-edition-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Yakov Fain, Anton Moiseev. This book covers Angular, TypeScript, Angular CLI, NgRx, Angular Material.

#### Publisher's Description
Angular Development with Typescript, Second Edition is an intermediate-level tutorial that introduces Angular and TypeScript to developers comfortable with building web applications using other frameworks and tools. You'll start by exploring what makes Angular different by building an online auction app. As you move through the chapters, you'll explore TypeScript as you learn to write type-aware classes, interfaces, generics, and more.

#### About the technology
Whether you're building lightweight web clients or full-featured SPAs, Angular is a liberating experience for developers used to other web frameworks. Angular feels like a natural extension to HTML, so you don't feel like you're constantly context-switching as you build up your applications. Angular's declarative style makes it easy to define and add features without dozens of lines of manually written boilerplate, and the fully integrated TypeScript language gives you the benefits of a statically typed language within the JavaScript ecosystem. Plus, adding Angular and TypeScript to your resume makes you a hot commodity. Learn Angular, and your apps will be better, you'll be more productive, and you'll be in demand too!

#### About the book
This practical book covers real-world development concerns like state management, data and views, user interaction with forms, and communicating with servers, as well as testing and deploying your applications. This new edition has been fully revised to cover the latest Angular CLI along with current best practices and updates to Angular 5.

#### What's inside
* Angular CLI
* TypeScript programming
* Creating a modern-looking UI with Angular Material
* Dependency Injection
* Reactive programming
* Working with the Angular Forms API
* Maintaining the app state with ngrx

#### About the reader
Written for intermediate web developers. No prior TypeScript or AngularJS experience is required.

#### About the authors
**Yakov Fain** and **Anton Moiseev** are experienced web application developers. Yakov has written several books on software development.

[![Angular in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/angular-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jeremy Wilken. This book covers Angular, TypeScript, Angular CLI.

#### Publisher's Description
Angular in Action teaches you modern application development with Angular. You'll begin with the basics of Angular and the technologies and techniques you'll use throughout the book, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. Next, you'll build an Angular application from scratch. You'll learn about the primary pieces of an Angular application and see how they work together. Using lots of examples, you'll learn the core parts of Angular, such as Components, the Router, and Services. You'll also learn techniques like server-side rendering. Finally, you'll gain insight into advanced skills that should be part of any professional Angular developer's toolkit, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning.

#### About the technology
When you move beyond building simple web sites or small applications, things get complicated. Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, you have to juggle competing user interactions, integrating the work of multiple developers is tricky, and you need a defined process to manage, test, and deploy your code. That's where the Angular platform can help you. This application-oriented platform lets you focus on development by handling these common issues, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. And because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, the new version of Angular emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. And it's designed for the future by paying attention to browser standards that are coming soon, rather than older standards that will soon be obsolete.

#### What's inside
* What you need to know to succeed with Angular
* Jumpstarting your first Angular application
* Hands-on with Angular's features
* Tooling you need to know and use for testing and debugging
* How to build Angular for production and how to manage large applications

#### About the reader
This book assumes you know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No prior exposure to AngularJS or other web frameworks is required. Knowledge of TypeScript and ES6 is helpful but not required.

#### About the Author
**Jeremy Wilken** is a web application engineer with a focus on building web applications at companies like eBay, Teradata, and VMware. He is a Google Developer Expert for Angular and Web Technologies and regularly speaks at events and writes around the web. He is also the author of Ionic in Action, a mobile application framework. He lives in Austin, Texas with his family and enjoys brewing his own beers.

[![Testing Angular Applications](/assets/img/learning/manning/testing-angular-applications-final.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jesse Palmer, Corinna Cohn, Michael Giambalvo, Craig Nishina. This book covers Angular, TypeScript, Angular CLI, Protractor.

#### Publisher's Description
The Angular framework is great for building large-scale web applications that can be maintained and extended. And when you're building enterprise-level apps, testing is vital to the development process. Testing improves the quality of code and reduces maintenance, saving both time and money. Even though testing is crucial, it's sometimes neglected since there are few established resources and standards when it comes to modern JavaScript web applications. Developers who know how to build and leverage tests are highly valued by their clients and companies.

#### About the book
Testing Angular Applications is an example-rich, hands-on guide that gives you the real-world techniques you need to thoroughly test all parts of your Angular applications. You'll start with an introduction to Angular, TypeScript, testing fundamentals, and the testing frameworks and tools used in the book and begin writing your first tests. Next, you'll learn how to set-up your Angular environment, including TypeScript and the Angular dependencies and you'll create your first component. The second part of the book focuses on the most important concepts of Angular, such as testing components, directives, pipes, services, and routing. By the end of this book, you'll be able to confidently write unit and end-to-end tests for Angular applications in TypeScript.

#### What's inside
* Getting to know TypeScript
* Writing and debugging tests
* Testing components, directives, services and pipes
* Unit testing
* End-to-end testing

#### About the reader
This book is for readers with intermediate JavaScript skills and some experience with JavaScript frameworks. No experience with testing or Angular required.

#### About the authors
