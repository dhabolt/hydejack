### <a name="packt-daily"></a><small>Free</small> [Object-Oriented JavaScript, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) 
[![Object-Oriented JavaScript, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/packt/object-oriented-javascript-second-edition.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Stoyan Stefanov, Kumar Chetan Sharma (valid through 10/27 at 19:00 EST). This book covers JavaScript, Object-Oriented Programming, Closures, Prototype, Firebug, Singleton, Decorator, Observer.

#### Publisher's Description
**Learn everything you need to know about OOJS in this comprehensive guide**

JavaScript is the behavior, the third pillar in today's paradigm that looks at web pages as something that consists of clearly distinguishable parts: content (HTML), presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript). Using JavaScript, you can create not only web pages but also desktop widgets, browser and application extensions, and other pieces of software. It's a pretty good deal: you learn one language and then code all kinds of different applications. While there's one chapter specifically dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, Events and AJAX tutorials, the rest is applicable to the other environments

Many web developers have tried coding or adopting some bits of JavaScript, but it is time to "man up" and learn the language properly because it is the language of the browser and is, virtually, everywhere. This book starts from zero, not assuming any prior JavaScript programming knowledge and takes you through all the in-depth and exciting futures hidden behind the facade.

Once listed in the "nice to have" sections of job postings, these days the knowledge of JavaScript is a deciding factor when it comes to hiring web developers. After reading this book you'll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe didn't know. You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.

#### What You Will Learn
* The basics of object-oriented programming, and how to apply it in the JavaScript environment
* How to set up and use your training environment (Firebug)
* In depth discussion of data types, operators, and flow control statements in JavaScript
* In depth discussion of functions, function usage patterns, and variable scope
* Understand how prototypes work
* Reuse code with common patterns for inheritance
* Make your programs cleaner, faster and compatible with other programs and libraries
* Use object-oriented JavaScript for improving script performance
* Achieve missing object-oriented features in JavaScript

#### Publisher's Description
* Provides useful code examples of real-world situations and solutions to common problems
* Provides an end-to-end example solution which can be expanded upon by the reader
* Gives extensive case studies and application examples from a variety of domains and problem areas

Learn advanced analytical techniques and leverage existing tool kits to make your analytic applications more powerful, precise, and efficient. This book provides the right combination of architecture, design, and implementation information to create analytical systems that go beyond the basics of classification, clustering, and recommendation.

Pro Hadoop Data Analytics emphasizes best practices to ensure coherent, efficient development. A complete example system will be developed using standard third-party components that consist of the tool kits, libraries, visualization and reporting code, as well as support glue to provide a working and extensible end-to-end system.

The book also highlights the importance of end-to-end, flexible, configurable, high-performance data pipeline systems with analytical components as well as appropriate visualization results. You'll discover the importance of mix-and-match or hybrid systems, using different analytical components in one application. This hybrid approach will be prominent in the examples.

#### What You'll Learn 
* Build big data analytic systems with the Hadoop ecosystem
* Use libraries, tool kits, and algorithms to make development easier and more effective
* Apply metrics to measure performance and efficiency of components and systems
* Connect to standard relational databases, noSQL data sources, and more
* Follow case studies with example components to create your own systems

### <a name="new1"></a>[Software Design X-Rays](https://pragprog.com/book/atevol/software-design-x-rays) Fix Technical Debt with Behavioral Code Analysis
[![Software Design X-Rays](/assets/img/learning/pragmatic/software-design-x-rays.jpg)](https://pragprog.com/book/atevol/software-design-x-rays)
[Software Design X-Rays](https://pragprog.com/book/atevol/software-design-x-rays) Fix Technical Debt with Behavioral Code Analysis by Adam Tornhill. This book covers Software Design, Technical Debt, CodeScene, Conway's Law, Modular Monoliths, Refactor.

#### Publisher's Description
Are you working on a codebase where cost overruns, death marches, and heroic fights with legacy code monsters are the norm? Battle these adversaries with novel ways to identify and prioritize technical debt, based on behavioral data from how developers work with code. And that’s just for starters. Because good code involves social design, as well as technical design, you can find surprising dependencies between people and code to resolve coordination bottlenecks among teams. Best of all, the techniques build on behavioral data that you already have: your version-control system. Join the fight for better code!

#### About this Title
Use statistics and data science to uncover both problematic code and the behavioral patterns of the developers who build your software. This combination gives you insights you can’t get from the code alone. Use these insights to prioritize refactoring needs, measure their effect, find implicit dependencies between different modules, and automatically create knowledge maps of your system based on actual code contributions.

In a radical, much-needed change from common practice, guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Discover a comprehensive set of practical analysis techniques based on version-control data, where each point is illustrated with a case study from a real-world codebase. Because the techniques are language neutral, you can apply them to your own code no matter what programming language you use. Guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Apply research findings from social psychology to software development, ensuring you get the tools you need to coach your organization toward better code.

If you’re an experienced programmer, software architect, or technical manager, you’ll get a new perspective that will change how you work with code.

#### What You Need
You don’t have to install anything to follow along in the book. The case studies in the book use well-known open source projects hosted on GitHub. You’ll use CodeScene, a free software analysis tool for open source projects, for the case studies. We also discuss alternative tooling options where they exist.

#### About the Author
**Adam Tornhill** is a programmer who combines degrees in engineering and psychology. He’s the founder of Empear, where he designs tools for software analysis. Adam is the author of Your Code as a Crime Scene, Lisp for the Web, and Patterns in C. His other interests include modern history, music, and martial arts.
