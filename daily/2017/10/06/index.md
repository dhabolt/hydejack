[![Beginning C++ Game Programming](/assets/img/learning/packt/beginning-cpp-game-programming.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by John Horton (valid through 10/06 at 19:00 EST). This book covers C++, Game Programming, SFML, Standard Template Library, OpenGL.

#### Publisher's Description
This book is all about offering you a fun introduction to the world of game programming, C++, and the OpenGL-powered SFML using three fun, fully-playable games. These games are an addictive frantic two-button tapper, a multi-level zombie survival shooter, and a split-screen multiplayer puzzle-platformer.

We will start with the very basics of programming, such as variables, loops, and conditions and you will become more skillful with each game as you move through the key C++ topics, such as OOP (Object-Orientated Programming), C++ pointers, and an introduction to the Standard Template Library. While building these games, you will also learn exciting game programming concepts like particle effects, directional sound (spatialization), OpenGL programmable Shaders, spawning thousands of objects, and more.

#### What You Will Learn
* Get to know C++ from scratch while simultaneously learning game building
* Learn the basics of C++, such as variables, loops, and functions to animate game objects, respond to collisions, keep score, play sound effects, and build your first playable game.
* Use more advanced C++ topics such as classes, inheritance, and references to spawn and control thousands of enemies, shoot with a rapid fire machine gun, and realize random scrolling game-worlds
* Stretch your C++ knowledge beyond the beginner level and use concepts such as pointers, references, and the Standard Template Library to add features like split-screen coop, immersive directional sound, and custom levels loaded from level-design files
* Get ready to go and build your own unique games!

[![Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js](/assets/img/learning/manning/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudia-js-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Slobodan Stojanovic, Aleksandar Simovic. This book covers Node.js, Claudia.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Microservices, Amazon Alexa.

#### Publisher's Description
First the buzzwords: Serverless computing. AWS Lambda. API Gateway. Node.js. Microservices. Cloud-hosted functions. That's an impressive-sounding list, but what's the point? Beyond the buzzwords are real benefits like fast design-to-deployment times, low hosting costs, and efficient scaling and application management, along with real technologies that deliver them.

Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js walks you through building serverless apps on AWS using JavaScript. Inside, you'll create a full project designed to help you understand and apply general serverless design principles and concepts. Along the way, you'll also discover what Claudia brings to the table as you build and deploy a scalable event-based serverless application that is fully integrated with AWS services including Lambda and API Gateway. You'll learn to simplify the design and development process so you can focus on getting your application deployed as fast as possible without sacrificing quality. Plus, you'll learn how to migrate your existing Express apps to serverless!

#### About the technology
Serverless computing services like AWS Lambda and API Gateway can be tedious to set up, aren't designed to work well with JavaScript and Node, and most of the quirks and gotchas aren't well documented. A new generation of serverless tools, including Claudia.js, make it radically easier to set up serverless web applications so you can focus on what your app does instead of meddling with infrastructure configuration and deployment. Claudia doesn't alter your project layout or abstract away the core AWS services; it just makes it easier to get started with them!

#### What's inside
* Creating a serverless API using AWS Lambda and Claudia.js
* Doing authentication and database storage in a serverless way
* Creating a chatbot for multiple platforms
* Building a voice assistant with Amazon Alexa
* Developing microservices with Node.js, AWS Lambda, S3, and more

#### About the reader
Written for beginner and intermediate web developers comfortable with JavaScript and Node.js. Some prior experience with AWS is required.

#### About the authors
**Slobodan Stojanovic** and **Aleksandar Simovicv** are core contributors to the Claudia.js project and are the lead developers and maintainers of Claudia Bot Builder. They work closely with Claudia.js founder Gojko AdÅ¾ic, and present serverless and Claudia.js at conferences and workshops.

### <a name="manning-daily-2"></a><small>50% off</small> [AWS Lambda in Action](https://www.manning.com/dotd) Event-driven serverless applications
[![AWS Lambda in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/aws-lambda-in-action.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Danilo Poccia with foreword by James Governor. This book covers AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS IAM, Amazon Cognito.

#### Publisher's Description
AWS Lambda in Action is an example-driven tutorial that teaches you how to build applications that use an event-driven approach on the back end.

#### About the technology
With AWS Lambda, you write your code and upload it to the AWS cloud. AWS Lambda responds to the events triggered by your application or your users, and automatically manages the underlying computer resources for you. Back-end tasks like analyzing a new document or processing requests from a mobile app are easy to implement. Your application is divided into small functions, leading naturally to a reactive architecture and the adoption of microservices.

#### About the book
AWS Lambda in Action is an example-driven tutorial that teaches you how to build applications that use an event-driven approach on the back-end. Starting with an overview of AWS Lambda, the book moves on to show you common examples and patterns that you can use to call Lambda functions from a web page or a mobile app. The second part of the book puts these smaller examples together to build larger applications. By the end, you'll be ready to create applications that take advantage of the high availability, security, performance, and scalability of AWS.

#### What's inside
* Create a simple API
* Create an event-driven media-sharing application
* Secure access to your application in the cloud
* Use functions from different clients like web pages or mobile apps
* Connect your application with external services

#### About the reader
Requires basic knowledge of JavaScript. Some examples are also provided in Python. No AWS experience is assumed.

#### About the author
**Danilo Poccia** is a technical evangelist at Amazon Web Services and a frequent speaker at public events and workshops.
