[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Tryggvi Bjorgvinsson. This book covers Big Data, Python, Data Usability.

#### Publisher's Description
You're planning a large event in Stockholm. It's important for you to know who is coming and when, but you don't need complete data about them-family history, employment status and property ownership is probably irrelevant. You need different things out of data for different situations. Crop forecasts are measured in days or weeks, while train schedules must be accurate within minutes or seconds. Knowing how data will be consumed and planning data projects accordingly is the essential art of data usability. Measures of data quality, such as precision, timeliness, format, and so on all depend on how those data are to be used.

#### About the book
The Art of Data Usability teaches you how to set up data projects in a way that maximizes their effectiveness for their intended users. In this interesting, practical guide, you'll master techniques for understanding the type and role of the data you have and preparing those data to maximize their value. With the help of dozens of real world examples that the author has faced before, you'll learn from them to piece together the perfect workflow for sorting through data for your clients, principles for establishing data projects, and techniques to apply to your datasets. Throw in a bit of coding, and you'll be more than prepared to get the data you have in the right shape, exactly when you need it.

#### What's inside
* The attributes of quality data
* Identifying user needs and requirements
* Using Python for data quality monitoring
* The correct way to disseminate your data
* Best practices and methods to improve data usability

#### About the reader
Written for readers comfortable with data management and common data formats such as CSV and JSON. Some examples require novice-level programming skills.

#### About the author
