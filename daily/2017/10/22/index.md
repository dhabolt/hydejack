[![Learning C++ by Creating Games with UE4](/assets/img/learning/packt/learning-cpp-by-creating-games-with-ue4.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by William Sherif (valid through 10/22 at 19:00 EST). This book covers C++, Game Programming, UE4.

#### Publisher's Description
Unreal Engine 4 is used to create top notch, exciting games by AAA studios, and learning to program in C++ needs some serious motivation.

Learning C++ by Creating Games With UE4 will start with the basics of C++: installing a code editor so you can begin to write C++ code. You will then learn how to write small, self-contained C++ programs that show you how to use the C++ language, without overwhelming you with too much code at the beginning. As we dig into more advanced C++ concepts, you will start to explore the functionality the UE4 engine has to offer. You will use the UE4 editor to create your own world, and then program in some seriously fun gameplay. By the end of this book, you should have a good grasp of how to program in C++.

#### What You Will Learn
* Visualize and truly understand C++ programming concepts, such as how data is saved in computer memory and how program flow works
* Write reusable code by grouping lines of code into functions
* Learn how inheritance works-how traits of a base class are passed on to derived classes
* Learn about dynamic allocation of new memory for your program
* Design your own world using the UE4 editor
* Practice programming by coding behaviors into your game world, including player inventory tracking, monsters, and NPCs

#### About the Author

[50% off InformIT eBook](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=O7eD6EjdUAQ&mid=24808&murl=http://www.informit.com/deals/) by Sandi Metz. This book covers Ruby, Object-Oriented Design, SOLID Principles, Duck Typing, Law of Demeter.

#### Publisher's Description
**The Complete Guide to Writing More Maintainable, Manageable, Pleasing, and Powerful Ruby Applications**

Ruby's widely admired ease of use has a downside: Too many Ruby and Rails applications have been created without concern for their long-term maintenance or evolution. The Web is awash in Ruby code that is now virtually impossible to change or extend. This text helps you solve that problem by using powerful real-world object-oriented design techniques, which it thoroughly explains using simple and practical Ruby examples.

Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a set of Ruby-focused practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She shows you how to build new applications that can survive success and repair existing applications that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples, all downloadable from the companion Web site, poodr.info.

The first title to focus squarely on object-oriented Ruby application design, Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby will guide you to superior outcomes, whatever your previous Ruby experience. Novice Ruby programmers will find specific rules to live by; intermediate Ruby programmers will find valuable principles they can flexibly interpret and apply; and advanced Ruby programmers will find a common language they can use to lead development and guide their colleagues.

#### This guide will help you
* Understand how object-oriented programming can help you craft Ruby code that is easier to maintain and upgrade
* Decide what belongs in a single Ruby class
* Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate
* Define flexible interfaces among objects
* Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing
* Successfully apply inheritance
* Build objects via composition
* Design cost-effective tests
* Solve common problems associated with poorly designed Ruby code

#### About the Author
**Sandi Metz** has 30 years of experience working on projects that survived to grow and change. She writes code every day as a software architect at Duke University, where her team solves real problems for customers who have large object oriented applications that have been evolving for more than 15 years. She’s committed to getting useful software out the door in extremely practical ways. Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby is the distillation of many years of white-board drawings and the logical culmination of a lifetime of conversations about object oriented design. Sandy has spoken several times at Gotham Ruby User’s Conference and lives in Durham, N.C.

[![The Art of Data Usability](/assets/img/learning/manning/the-art-of-data-usability.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Tryggvi Bjorgvinsson. This book covers Big Data, Python, Data Usability.

#### Publisher's Description
You're planning a large event in Stockholm. It's important for you to know who is coming and when, but you don't need complete data about them-family history, employment status and property ownership is probably irrelevant. You need different things out of data for different situations. Crop forecasts are measured in days or weeks, while train schedules must be accurate within minutes or seconds. Knowing how data will be consumed and planning data projects accordingly is the essential art of data usability. Measures of data quality, such as precision, timeliness, format, and so on all depend on how those data are to be used.

#### About the book
The Art of Data Usability teaches you how to set up data projects in a way that maximizes their effectiveness for their intended users. In this interesting, practical guide, you'll master techniques for understanding the type and role of the data you have and preparing those data to maximize their value. With the help of dozens of real world examples that the author has faced before, you'll learn from them to piece together the perfect workflow for sorting through data for your clients, principles for establishing data projects, and techniques to apply to your datasets. Throw in a bit of coding, and you'll be more than prepared to get the data you have in the right shape, exactly when you need it.

#### What's inside
* The attributes of quality data
* Identifying user needs and requirements
* Using Python for data quality monitoring
* The correct way to disseminate your data
* Best practices and methods to improve data usability

#### About the reader
Written for readers comfortable with data management and common data formats such as CSV and JSON. Some examples require novice-level programming skills.

#### About the author
**Tryggvi Björgvinsson** is the head of IT and dissemination at Statistics Iceland. He holds a Ph.D. in software engineering.
