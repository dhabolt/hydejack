#### Publisher's Description
**Leverage the power of Unity 5 to create fun and unbelievable AI entities in your games!**

Unity 5 provides game and app developers with a variety of tools to implement artificial intelligence. Leveraging these tools via Unity’s API or built-in features allows limitless possibilities when it comes to creating your game’s worlds and characters. Whether you are developing traditional, serious, educational, or any other kind of game, understanding how to apply artificial intelligence can take the fun-factor to the next level!

This book helps you break down artificial intelligence into simple concepts to give the reader a fundamental understanding of the topic to build upon. Using a variety of examples, the book then takes those concepts and walks you through actual implementations designed to highlight key concepts, and features related to game AI in Unity 5. Along the way, several tips and tricks are included to make the development of your own AI easier and more efficient.

Starting from covering the basic essential concepts to form a base for the later chapters in the book, you will learn to distinguish the state machine pattern along with implementing your own. This will be followed by learning how to implement a basic sensory system for your AI agent and coupling it with a finite state machine (FSM). Next you will be taught how to use Unity’s built-in NavMesh feature and implement your own A* pathfinding system. Then you will learn how to implement simple flocks and crowd’s dynamics, the key AI concepts. Then moving on you will learn how a behavior tree works and its implementation. Next you will learn adding layer of realism by combining fuzzy logic concepts with state machines. Lastly, you learn applying all the concepts in the book by combining them in a simple tank game.

#### What You Will Learn
* Understand the basic terminology and concepts in game AI
* Implement a basic finite state machine using state machine behaviors in Unity 5

#### Publisher's Description
Vue is a powerful web framework that changes the way you build web UI. To test applications built with Vue, you need to master a new set of tools and techniques designed to work with Vue's unique reactive design and the flexible collection of components that make up the Vue stack. Mastering Vue testing not only improves the quality of your apps, it guarantees that you understand how your apps work top-to-bottom and end to end.

#### About the technology
Vue.js is one of the fastest growing and most popular open-source JavaScript frameworks around. Vue's meteoric success is found in its simplicity and short learning curve, but few resources are available to teach you how to test a Vue application effectively and efficiently. None of those resources are comprehensive—a blog post here, a chapter there. This book will put an end to your search!

#### About the book
Testing Vue.js Applications is a comprehensive guide to testing Vue components, methods, events, and output. Author Edd Yerburgh, creator of the Vue testing utility avoriaz, teaches you how to set up effective testing practices. You'll use the Jest framework to run tests for a Hacker News application built with Vue, Vuex and Vue Router.

[![Vue.js in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/vue-js-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Erik Hanchett, Benjamin Listwon. This book covers Vue.js, Reactive UI, MVVM, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
Web pages are rich with data and graphics, and it's challenging to maintain a smooth, quick user experience. Vue.js in Action teaches you to build fast, flowing web UI with the Vue.js framework. This practical book starts with a mental model of the reactive UI pattern and an overview of Vue.js. Then, by exploring hands-on examples, you'll learn how to interact directly with the DOM, work with events, loops, and build the View and ViewModel. You'll also learn how to extend your Vue.js app, add transitions, test for bugs, and more. As you move through the book, you'll put your skills to practice by building a complete web store application with product listings, a checkout process, and an administrative interface!

#### About the technology
Vue.js is a front-end framework that builds on many of the reactive UI ideas introduced in React.js. As a second-generation reactive UI framework, Vue was designed from the ground up with developer usability in mind. It's far more intuitive than React, featuring a clean event lifecycle, easy two-way data binding, and a common-sense project structure. By interacting directly with the DOM and not having to script all user interactions, anyone with basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills can build fast interactive UIs. Compared to Angular and React, Vue is faster, and its lightweight design requires a smaller footprint.

#### What's inside
* Adding View and ViewModel interactivity
* Working with components
* Extending Vue.js with custom plugins and directives
* Modeling data and consuming APIs

#### About the reader
Written for web developers with beginning to intermediate in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Publisher's Description
SOLIDWORKS has been a leader in the CAD industry since it was introduced over 20 years ago. In this course, SOLIDWORKS: Consumer Product Surfacing Design Techniques, you'll learn a bit about complex surfacing in SOLIDWORKS. This course will start with a sample file containing various parts of a car already complete. 

First, you'll start with the wheels in place, the glass modeled, and will be walked through the process of making a fender. Next, once your fender is complete, you'll then jump over to a more complete car file and begin work on the front bumper. 

Breaking the car down into several smaller areas will allow you an opportunity to focus on the detail features needed to undertake a project like this without the daunting task of completing the entire model. 

Finally, you'll take a look at one last file and use some surface and solid tools to put on the final touches. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation with SOLIDWORKS in general. Software required: SOLIDWORKS.

#### About the Author
