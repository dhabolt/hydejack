[![Kali Linux 2: Windows Penetration Testing](/assets/img/learning/packt/kali-linux-2-windows-penetration-testing.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Wolf Halton, Bo Weaver (valid through 10/24 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Kali Linux 2, Windows Penetration Testing.

#### Publisher's Description
Microsoft Windows is one of the two most common OS and managing its security has spawned the discipline of IT security. Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS.

This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali's top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system's DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important.

Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege’s escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.

#### What You Will Learn
Set up Kali Linux for pen testing
Map and enumerate your Windows network
Exploit several common Windows network vulnerabilities
Attack and defeat password schemes on Windows
Debug and reverse-engineer Windows programs
Recover lost files, investigate successful hacks and discover hidden data in innocent-looking files
Catch and hold admin rights on the network, and maintain backdoors on the network after your initial testing is done

[![Dependency Injection in .NET, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/manning/dependency-injection-in-dotnet-second-edition.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Steven van Deursen, Mark Seemann. This book covers Dependency Injection, .NET Framework, C#, Aspect-Oriented Programming, Autofac, Simple Injector, .NET Core DI, Inversion of Control.

#### Publisher's Description
Dependency Injection in .NET, Second Edition teaches you to use Dependency Injection to reduce hard-coded dependencies between application components. You'll start by learning what DI is and what types of applications will benefit from it. Then, you'll work through concrete scenarios using C# and the .NET framework to implement DI in your own projects. As you dive into the thoroughly-explained examples, you'll develop a foundation you can apply to any of the many DI libraries for .NET and .NET Core.

#### About the technology
Dependency Injection is an application design pattern where components are loosely-coupled with the objects or data on which they have a dependency. The dependent component broadcasts its need, and an external service composes the objects, or "injects" the "dependency". This basic pattern allows objects to work together without being bound into rigid, pre-defined architectures and communication. Dependency Injection has become one of the most dominant practices in the past decade, and it's now required knowledge for .NET developers.

#### What's inside
* DI patterns and anti-patterns
* Aspect-oriented programming
* Integration with common .NET application frameworks
* Using Microsoft and open source DI libraries and containers

#### About the reader
This book is written for intermediate .NET developers and beyond. No previous experience with DI or DI frameworks is required.

#### About the technology
Core concerns that cut across all parts of your application, such as logging or authorization, are difficult to maintain independently. In aspect-oriented programming (AOP) you isolate these cross-cutting concerns into their own classes, disentangling them from business logic. Mature AOP tools like PostSharp and Castle DynamicProxy now offer .NET developers the level of support Java coders have relied on for years.

#### About the book
AOP in .NET introduces aspect-oriented programming and provides guidance on how to get the most practical benefit from this technique.
