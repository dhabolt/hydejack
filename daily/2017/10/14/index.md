[![Cloud Native](/assets/img/learning/manning/cloud-native.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Cornelia Davis. This book covers Cloud Native, Cloud Computing.

#### Publisher's Description
Author Cornelia Davis likes to say that "the cloud" is more about how you design your applications than where you deploy them. Cloud Native: Designing Change-tolerant Software is your guide to developing strong applications that thrive in the dynamic, distributed, virtual world of the cloud. This book presents a mental model for cloud-native applications, along with the patterns, practices, and tooling that sets them apart. In it, you'll find realistic examples and expert advice for working with apps, data, services, routing, and more.

#### About the technology
We are amid a radical change in how we design and build applications. With cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, even small teams can take full advantage of web-scale distributed application patterns and practice. Users and customers have higher expectations for reliability, availability, and performance. Cloud-native software promises near-zero downtime, shortened feedback cycles, multi-device support, and improved cost control. All this means developers need to learn new skills and techniques, along with a new way of thinking about application design.

#### What's inside
* The application lifecycle of Cloud Native apps
* Automated configuration management
* Multi-tenant services, versioned services, and parallel deploys
* Understanding Cloud Native Routing
* Managing dependencies between apps and services

#### About the reader
Requires intermediate programming skill with Java or a similar language. Some experience with server-side development is helpful.

#### About the author
**Cornelia Davis** is the Sr. Director of Technology at Pivotal Software. A teacher at heart, Cornelia has spent the last 25 making better software and better software developers.

[![Kubernetes in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/kubernetes-in-action.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Marko Lukša. This book covers Kubernetes, Docker, Google Container Engine.

#### Publisher's Description
Monolithic applications are becoming a thing of the past as we move towards smaller, independently running microservices that can be developed, deployed, updated and scaled individually. But it can be difficult to configure, manage, and keep the whole system running properly. This is where Kubernetes comes in. Think of Kubernetes as an operating system for your cluster, making it easier to organize and schedule your application's components across a fleet of machines. With Kubernetes, you don't have to worry about which specific machine in your data center your application is running on. And even better, it provides you with primitives for health checking and replicating your application across these machines. Each layer in your application is decoupled from other layers so you can scale, update, and maintain them independently. With more and more big companies accepting the Kubernetes model as the best way to run apps, it is set to become the standard way of running distributed apps both in the cloud and local on-premises infrastructure.

#### About the book
Kubernetes in Action teaches developers how to use Kubernetes to deploy self-healing scalable distributed applications. This clearly-written guide begins by looking at the problems system administrators and software developers face when running microservice-based applications and how deploying onto Kubernetes solves them. Next, you'll get your feet wet by running your first simple containerized web application on a Kubernetes cluster running in Google Container Engine. The second part of the book explains the main concepts developers need to understand in order to run multi-component applications in Kubernetes, while the last part will explain what goes on inside Kubernetes and teach you how to tie everything you've learned in the first two parts together. By the end, you'll be able to build and deploy applications in a proper way to take full advantage of the Kubernetes platform.

#### What's inside
* Using Docker and Kubernetes
* Deploying containers by creating Pods
* Securely delivering sensitive information to containers
* Understanding Kubernetes internals
* Monitoring distributed apps
* Automatically scaling your system

#### About the reader
The book is for both application developers as well as system administrators who want to learn about Kubernetes from the developer's perspective

#### About the author
**Marko Lukša** is a software engineer at Red Hat with the Cloud Enablement Team, whose responsibility is to make Red Hat's Enterprise Middleware products run on OpenShift, the PaaS platform built on top of Kubernetes. He also has 15 years of teaching others, helping him understand the learner's perspective and how to present difficult topics in a clear and understandable way.
