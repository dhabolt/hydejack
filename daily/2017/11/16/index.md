[![Learning Python Design Patterns, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/packt/learning-python-design-patterns-second-edition.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Chetan Giridhar (valid through 11/16 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Design Patterns, Python 3, Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern, Facade Pattern, Proxy Pattern, Observer Pattern, Command Pattern, Template Method Pattern, Model-View-Controller, State Pattern.

#### Publisher's Description
**Leverage the power of Python design patterns to solve real-world problems in software architecture and design**

With the increasing focus on optimized software architecture and design it is important that software architects think about optimizations in object creation, code structure, and interaction between objects at the architecture or design level. This makes sure that the cost of software maintenance is low and code can be easily reused or is adaptable to change. The key to this is reusability and low maintenance in design patterns.

Building on the success of the previous edition, Learning Python Design Patterns, Second Edition will help you implement real-world scenarios with Python’s latest release, Python v3.5.

We start by introducing design patterns from the Python perspective. As you progress through the book, you will learn about Singleton patterns, Factory patterns, and Façade patterns in detail. After this, we’ll look at how to control object access with proxy patterns. It also covers observer patterns, command patterns, and compound patterns.

By the end of the book, you will have enhanced your professional abilities in software architecture, design, and development.

#### What You Will Learn
* Enhance your skills to create better software architecture
* Understand proven solutions to commonly occurring design issues
* Explore the design principles that form the basis of software design, such as loose coupling, the Hollywood principle and the Open Close principle among others
* Delve into the object-oriented programming concepts and find out how they are used in software applications
* Develop an understanding of Creational Design Patterns and the different object creation methods that help you solve issues in software development
* Use Structural Design Patterns and find out how objects and classes interact to build larger applications
* Focus on the interaction between objects with the command and observer patterns
* Improve the productivity and code base of your application using Python design patterns

### <a name="manning-daily-1"></a><small>50% off</small> [Reactive Web Applications](https://www.manning.com/dotd) Covers Play, Akka, and Reactive Streams
[![Reactive Web Applications](/assets/img/learning/manning/reactive-web-applications.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Manuel Bernhardt with foreword by James Roper. This book covers Play, Akka, Reactive Streams, Scala, Actor Model, CQRS, Event Sourcing, AngularJS, Java, Reactive Programming, Functional Programming.

#### Publisher's Description
Reactive Web Applications teaches web developers how to benefit from the reactive application architecture and presents hands-on examples using the Play framework.

#### About the technology
Reactive applications build on top of components that communicate asynchronously as they react to user and system events. As a result, they become scalable, responsive, and fault-tolerant. Java and Scala developers can use the Play Framework and the Akka concurrency toolkit to easily implement reactive applications without building everything from scratch.

#### About the book
Reactive Web Applications teaches web developers how to benefit from the reactive application architecture and presents hands-on examples using Play, Akka, Scala, and Reactive Streams. This book starts by laying out the fundamentals required for writing functional and asynchronous applications and quickly introduces Play as a framework to handle the plumbing of your application. The book alternates between chapters that introduce reactive ideas (asynchronous programming with futures and actors, managing distributed state with CQRS) and practical examples that show you how to build these ideas into your applications.

#### What's inside
* Reactive application architecture
* Basics of Play and Akka
* Examples in Scala
* Functional and asynchronous programming

#### About the reader
For readers comfortable programming with a higher-level language such as Java or C#, and who can read Scala code. No experience with Play or Akka needed.

#### About the author
**Manuel Bernhardt** is a passionate engineer, author, and speaker. As a consultant, he guides companies through the technological and organizational transformation to distributed computing.

[![Reactive Application Development](/assets/img/learning/manning/reactive-application-development-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Duncan K. DeVore, Sean Walsh, Brian Hanafee. This book covers Reactive Programming, Akka, Scala, Java, Actors, Domain-Driven Design, Typesafe Stack, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Microservices, RESTful APIs, Play, Lagom, Docker.

#### Publisher's Description
Reactive Application Development teaches you how to build reactive applications using the Typesafe stack. The book starts with an architectural overview that teaches you how a reactive application works and shows you where the various technologies you'll use fit into the system. Then you'll tackle the many moving pieces of a reactive application, learning to apply patterns such as CQRS, Event Sourcing, Microservices and more. Along the way, you'll learn how to build distributed domain models for reactive applications and clustered actor systems for elasticity and resilience, as well as how to integrate reactive systems with traditional architectures. You'll also pick up techniques for testing reactive applications, refactoring existing systems, and designing RESTful APIs.

#### About the technology
Modern distributed applications run in environments that may include thousands of processors, web and mobile clients, hybrid cloud deployments, and petabytes of data. The traditional patterns and practices for enterprise application development simply can't deliver the millisecond response times and near-perfect reliability these systems require. Reactive applications meet these demands by employing a loosely-coupled system of independent, isolated components that communicate via asynchronous message passing. These systems are highly responsive to changes in load, extremely fault tolerant through self-healing, and designed to elastically scale. For developers working in JVM-based systems, the Typesafe stack, anchored by the Java and Scala programming languages and the Akka toolkit and runtime, gives developers the tools to build a production-ready reactive application platform.

#### What's inside
* Learn to build production-quality distributed applications that apply reactive design patterns
* Incorporate Actor-based scalable parallelism using Akka
* Design distributed domain models that are elastic
* Build systems that are fault-tolerant and self-healing
* Employ techniques such as CQRS and Event Sourcing to capture behavior
* Efficiently handle large volumes of data and heavy user demand

#### About the reader
Readers should have some familiarity with traditional distributed application architecture and be comfortable reading Java and Scala code. Some familiarity with Akka and functional programming is helpful but not required.

#### About the authors
**Duncan DeVore** works at Typesafe, is a committer on the original event-sourced project that became Akka Persistence, and maintains the Akka Persistence Mongo Plugin. 

**Sean Walsh** is CEO of reactibility.com and a seasoned architect with deep expertise in the Typesafe stack. He consults and evangelizes about reactive architectures. Together, Duncan and Sean deployed one of the first large scale Reactive applications to production. 

**Brian Hanafee** is a Principal Systems Architect at a large financial institution, with experience building reliable and secure web-based applications and backing services for millions of customers.
