[![Mastering Git](/assets/img/learning/packt/mastering-git.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Jakub Narebski (valid through 11/05 at 19:00 EST). This book covers git.

#### Publisher's Description
**Attain expert-level proficiency with Git for enhanced productivity and efficient collaboration by mastering advanced distributed version control features**

Git is one of the most popular types of Source Code Management (SCM) and Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). Despite the powerful and versatile nature of the tool enveloping strong support for nonlinear development and the ability to handle large projects efficiently, it is a complex tool and often regarded as “user-unfriendly”. Getting to know the ideas and concepts behind the architecture of Git will help you make full use of its power and understand its behavior. Learning the best practices and recommended workflows should help you to avoid problems and ensure trouble-free development.

The book scope is meticulously designed to help you gain deeper insights into Git's architecture, its underlying concepts, behavior, and best practices. Mastering Git starts with a quick implementation example of using Git for a collaborative development of a sample project to establish the foundation knowledge of Git operational tasks and concepts. Furthermore, as you progress through the book, the tutorials provide detailed descriptions of various areas of usage: from archaeology, through managing your own work, to working with other developers. This book also helps augment your understanding to examine and explore project history, create and manage your contributions, set up repositories and branches for collaboration in centralized and distributed version control, integrate work from other developers, customize and extend Git, and recover from repository errors. By exploring advanced Git practices, you will attain a deeper understanding of Git’s behavior, allowing you to customize and extend existing recipes and write your own.

#### What You Will Learn
* Explore project history, find revisions using different criteria, and filter and format how history looks
* Manage your working directory and staging area for commits and interactively create new revisions and amend them
* Set up repositories and branches for collaboration
* Submit your own contributions and integrate contributions from other developers via merging or rebasing
* Customize Git behavior system-wide, on a per-user, per-repository, and per-file basis
* Take up the administration and set up of Git repositories, configure access, find and recover from repository errors, and perform repository maintenance
* Chose a workflow and configure and set up support for the chosen workflow

#### About the Author
**Jakub Narebski** followed Git development from the very beginning of its creation. He is one of the main contributors to the gitweb subsystem (the original web interface for Git), and is an unofficial gitweb maintainer. He created, announced, and analyzed annual Git User's Surveys from 2007 till 2012—all except the first one (you can find his analysis of those surveys on the Git Wiki). He shares his expertise with the technology on the StackOverflow question-and-answer website.

He was one of the proofreaders of the Version Control by Example by Eric Sink, and was the reason why it has chapter on Git.

He is an assistant professor in the faculty of mathematics and computer science at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland. He uses Git as a version control system of choice both for personal and professional work, teaching it to computer science students as a part of their coursework.
