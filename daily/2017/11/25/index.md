[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Stephen Samuel, Stefan Bocutiu (valid through 11/25 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Kotlin, Microservices, Lagom.

#### Publisher's Description
**Familiarize yourself with all of Kotlin's features with this in-depth guide**

Kotlin has been making waves ever since it was open sourced by JetBrains in 2011; it has been praised by developers across the world and is already being adopted by companies. This book provides a detailed introduction to Kotlin that shows you all its features and will enable you to write Kotlin code to production.

We start with the basics: get you familiar with running Kotlin code, setting up, tools, and instructions that you can use to write basic programs. Next, we cover object oriented code: functions, lambdas, and properties - all while using Kotlin's new features.

Then, we move on to null safety aspects and type parameterization. We show you how to destructure expressions and even write your own. We also take you through important topics like testing, concurrency, microservices, and a whole lot more. By the end of this book you will be able to compose different services and build your own applications.

[![ASP.NET Core in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/asp-net-core-in-action.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Andrew Lock. This book covers ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, ASP.NET, C#, Entity Framework Core.

#### Publisher's Description
ASP.NET Core is a re-imagining of the .NET Framework that frees developers from Visual Studio and Windows. You can now build and run cross-platform .NET applications on any OS, with any IDE, and using the tools that you choose. The entire framework is open-source, and has been developed with many contributions from the community. While ASP.NET Core is relatively new, Microsoft is heavily investing in it, promoting ASP.NET Core as their web framework of choice for the foreseeable future. Whether you are building traditional web applications or highly performant APIs for client side or mobile applications, ASP.NET Core could be the framework for you.

ASP.NET Core in Action is for C# developers without any web development experience who want to get started and productive using ASP.NET Core to build web applications. In the first half of the book, you will work through the basics of a typical ASP.NET Core application, focusing on how to create basic web pages and APIs using MVC controllers and the Razor templating engine. In the second half, you will build on this core knowledge looking at more advanced requirements and how to add extra features to your application. You will learn how to secure your application behind a login screen, how to handle configuration and dependency injection, and how to deploy your application to production. In the last part of the book you will look in depth at further bending the framework to your will by creating custom components and using more advanced features of the framework.

#### What's inside
* Using MVC to deliver dynamically generated web pages
* Securing applications with login requirements
* Interacting with a RDMS using Entity Framework Core
* Publishing an ASP.NET Core application to a server
* Unit and integration testing
* Creating custom middleware and filters

[![Entity Framework Core in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/entity-framework-core-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by ZZ2. This book covers Entity Framework Core, C#, ASP.NET Core.

#### Publisher's Description
Reading and storing data is a core part of any application, and as a .NET developer you want database access to be easy and intuitive. Entity Framework Core is a .NET library designed to simplify data persistence, bridging the mismatch between the different structures of object-oriented code and relational databases. With EF Core, you can access data using abstract objects and properties without tightly coupling your code to the underlying relational database structure. And because it's part of Microsoft's open source .NET Core initiative, EF works on Windows, Linux and MacOS, and even mobile platforms via Microsoft's Xamarin.

#### About the book
Entity Framework Core in Action teaches developers how to add database functionality to .NET applications with EF Core. Part 1 starts with a clear introduction to what EF Core is and how it fits into your applications. Next, you'll get hands-on quickly by building a .NET application that uses a relational database with EF Core's default configuration. By the end of part 1 you will be able to build a well-structured application that uses EF Core for database access.

The second part of the book dives deeper and shows you how to change default settings as well as teaching you many EF Core commands. You'll learn how to create a database exactly the way you want it, as well as how to link to an existing database, and how to change the way database data is exposed inside your .NET application.

The last part is all about improving your skills and making you a better developer and debugger of EF Core applications. You'll learn from real-world applications of EF Core starting with a range of known patterns and practices that you can use, extending ER Core, and how to find and fix EF Core performance issues. Software developers who have never used Entity Framework and seasoned EF6.x developers, as well as anyone who wants to know what EF Core is capable of will find this book great at deepening their knowledge and making them more productive with EF Core.

#### What's inside
* Querying a database
* Creating, updating and deleting data
* Using EF Core in business logic
* Building a .NET web application EF Core

#### About the reader
This book assumes readers are familiar with .NET development and some understanding of what relational databases are. No experience with SQL needed.

#### About the author
**Jon Smith** is a full-stack software developer and architect who focuses on Microsoft's ASP.NET web applications using Entity Framework (EF) ORM on the server-side, with various front-end JavaScript libraries. Jon is especially interested in defining patterns and building libraries that improve the speed of development of ASP.NET web/database applications.

Microservices in .NET Core provides a complete guide to building microservice applications. After a crystal-clear introduction to the microservices architectural style, the book will teach you practical development skills in that style, using OWIN and Nancy.

#### About the technology
Microservice applications are built by connecting single-capability, autonomous components that communicate via APIs. These systems can be challenging to develop because they demand clearly defined interfaces and reliable infrastructure. Fortunately for .NET developers, OWIN (the Open Web Interface for .NET), and the Nancy web framework help minimize plumbing code and simplify the task of building microservice-based applications.

#### About the book
Microservices in .NET Core provides a complete guide to building microservice applications. After a crystal-clear introduction to the microservices architectural style, the book will teach you practical development skills in that style, using OWIN and Nancy.
