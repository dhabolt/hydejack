[![Building a Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi](/assets/img/learning/apress/building-a-virtual-assistant-for-raspberry-pi.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221662)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221662) by Tanay Pant. This book covers Virtual Assistant, Raspberry Pi, Python, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech.

#### Publisher's Description
* Develop your own voice controlled assistant, Melissa, in Python
* Learn concepts by making Melissa more intelligent as we progress along the book
* Strengthen concepts by building scalable modules for Melissa
* Discuss how Melissa can be scaled for enterprise quality products so that the learning continues

Build a voice-controlled virtual assistant using speech-to-text engines, text-to-speech engines, and conversation modules. This book shows you how to program the virtual assistant to gather data from the internet (weather data, data from Wikipedia, data mining); play music; and take notes. Each chapter covers building a mini project/module to make the virtual assistant better. You'll develop the software on Linux or OS X before transferring it to your Raspberry Pi, ready for deploying in your own home-automation or Internet of Things applications.

Building a Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi walks you through various STTs and TTSs and the implementation of these components with the help of Python. After that you will start implementing logic for handling user queries and commands, so that the user can have conversations with Melissa. You will then work to improve logic handling to detect what the user wants Melissa to do. You will also work on building some useful applications/modules for Melissa, which will allow you to gain interesting information from Melissa such as the time, weather information, and data from Wikipedia.

You will develop a music playing application as well as a note taking application for Melissa, laying the foundations for how Melissa can be further extended. Finally, you will learn how to deploy this software to your Raspberry Pi and how you can further scale Melissa to make her more intelligent, interactive and how you can use her in other projects such as home automation as well.

#### What You'll Learn
* Design the workflow and discover the concepts of building a voice controlled assistant
* Develop modules for having conversations with the assistant
* Enable the assistant to retrieve information from the internet
* Build utilities like a music player and a note taking application for the virtual assistant
* Integrate this software with a Raspberry Pi

#### Who This Book Is For
Anyone who has built a home automation project with Raspberry Pi and now want to enhance it by making it voice-controlled. The book would also interest students from computer science or related disciplines.

#### Publisher's Description
High-quality search is all about returning relevant results even when the data is changing or poorly structured, the queries are imprecise, and you're trying to make sense out of images and other non-text entries. Deep Learning for Search teaches you how to leverage neural networks, NLP, and deep learning techniques to improve search performance.

#### About the technology
Using deep learning and neural networks are the perfect way to create better search results, letting you fine tune what your search engines display, help speed up the results, and let you build a profile of your customers that let them find what they need every single time. And because deep learning systems improve the more you use them, your clients will also become happier in the bargain.

About the book
Deep Learning for Search teaches you how to improve the effectiveness of your search by implementing neural network-based techniques. You'll start with an overview of information retrieval principles, like indexing, searching, and ranking, as well as a fast indoctrination into deep learning. Then, you'll move through in-depth examples as you gain an understanding of how to improve typical search tasks, such as relevance, with the help of Apache Lucene and Deeplearning4j. The book wraps up with a look at advanced problems, like searching through images and translating user queries. By the time you're finished, you'll be ready to build amazing search engines that deliver the results your users need and get better as time goes on!

[![Grokking Deep Learning](/assets/img/learning/manning/grokking-deep-learning.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Andrew W. Trask. This book covers Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Python, Gradient Descent, MNIST, Natural Language Processing.

#### Publisher's Description
Artificial Intelligence is one of the most exciting technologies of the century, and Deep Learning is in many ways the "brain" behind some of the world's smartest Artificial Intelligence systems out there. Loosely based on neuron behavior inside of human brains, these systems are rapidly catching up with the intelligence of their human creators, defeating the world champion Go player, achieving superhuman performance on video games, driving cars, translating languages, and sometimes even helping law enforcement fight crime. Deep Learning is a revolution that is changing every industry across the globe.

Grokking Deep Learning is the perfect place to begin your deep learning journey. Rather than just learn the "black box" API of some library or framework, you will actually understand how to build these algorithms completely from scratch. You will understand how Deep Learning is able to learn at levels greater than humans. You will be able to understand the "brain" behind state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, unlike other courses that assume advanced knowledge of Calculus and leverage complex mathematical notation, if you're a Python hacker who passed high-school algebra, you're ready to go. And at the end, you'll even build an A.I. that will learn to defeat you in a classic Atari game.

#### About the technology
