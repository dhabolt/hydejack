### <a name="packt-daily"></a><small>Free</small> [Procedural Content Generation for Unity Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) 
[![Procedural Content Generation for Unity Game Development](/assets/img/learning/packt/procedural-content-generation-for-unity-game-development.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Ryan Watkins (valid through 11/18 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Procedural Content Generation, Unity 5.2.2, Game Development, C#, Pseudo Random Numbers.

#### Publisher's Description
**Harness the power of procedural content generation to design unique games with Unity**

Procedural Content Generation is a process by which game content is developed using computer algorithms, rather than through the manual efforts of game developers. This book teaches readers how to develop algorithms for procedural generation that they can use in their own games. These concepts are put into practice using C# and Unity is used as the game development engine.

This book provides the fundamentals of learning and continued learning using PCG. You'll discover the theory of PCG and the mighty Pseudo Random Number Generator. Random numbers such as die rolls and card drafting provide the chance factor that makes games fun and supplies spontaneity. This book also takes you through the full development of a 2D game.

Starting with level generation, you'll learn how PCG can make the game environment for you. You'll move into item generation and learn the different techniques to procedurally create game items. Thereafter, you'll be guided through the more abstract PCG areas such as scaling difficulty to the player and even generating music! The book helps you set up systems within your games where algorithms create computationally generated levels, art assets, quests, stories, characters, and weapons; these can substantially reduce the burden of manually creating every aspect of the game.

Finally, you'll get to try out your new PCG skills on 3D terrain generation.

#### What You Will Learn
* Understand the theory of Procedural Content Generation
* Learn the uses of Pseudo Random Numbers
* Create reusable algorithm designs for PCG
* Evaluate the data structures for PCG
* Develop smaller games with larger amounts of content
* Generate content instead of spending time designing every minute detail
* Learn when and how to add PCG to your game
* Learn the fundamental techniques of PCG

#### About the Author
**Ryan Watkins** was digitized and absorbed into his computer at an early age. In the digital realm, he learned the importance of video games and the balance they brought to the ecosystem of computing. Video games strive to always push the boundaries of what we know to be true while being a super-charged source of fun. Ryan formed friendships with many of the video games he encountered on his digital journeys, and in return, they shared the secrets of their creation with him. He has since returned to the physical world to share those secrets with the rest of us.

[![Vue.js in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/vue-js-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Erik Hanchett, Benjamin Listwon. This book covers Vue.js, Reactive UI, MVVM, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
Web pages are rich with data and graphics, and it's challenging to maintain a smooth, quick user experience. Vue.js in Action teaches you to build fast, flowing web UI with the Vue.js framework. This practical book starts with a mental model of the reactive UI pattern and an overview of Vue.js. Then, by exploring hands-on examples, you'll learn how to interact directly with the DOM, work with events, loops, and build the View and ViewModel. You'll also learn how to extend your Vue.js app, add transitions, test for bugs, and more. As you move through the book, you'll put your skills to practice by building a complete web store application with product listings, a checkout process, and an administrative interface!

#### About the technology
Vue.js is a front-end framework that builds on many of the reactive UI ideas introduced in React.js. As a second-generation reactive UI framework, Vue was designed from the ground up with developer usability in mind. It's far more intuitive than React, featuring a clean event lifecycle, easy two-way data binding, and a common-sense project structure. By interacting directly with the DOM and not having to script all user interactions, anyone with basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills can build fast interactive UIs. Compared to Angular and React, Vue is faster, and its lightweight design requires a smaller footprint.

#### What's inside
* Adding View and ViewModel interactivity
* Working with components
* Extending Vue.js with custom plugins and directives
* Modeling data and consuming APIs

#### About the reader
Written for web developers with beginning to intermediate in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### About the authors
**Erik Hanchett** is a software developer who loves all things JavaScript. 

**Benjamin Listwon** is an experienced designer and developer living in Seattle.

### <a name="manning-daily-2"></a><small>50% off</small> [Testing Vue.js Applications](https://www.manning.com/dotd) 
[![Testing Vue.js Applications](/assets/img/learning/manning/testing-vue-js-applications-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Edd Yerburgh. This book covers Vue.js, Software Testing, Unit Testing, End-to-End Testing, Vue Test Utils, Vuex, Jest, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
Vue is a powerful web framework that changes the way you build web UI. To test applications built with Vue, you need to master a new set of tools and techniques designed to work with Vue's unique reactive design and the flexible collection of components that make up the Vue stack. Mastering Vue testing not only improves the quality of your apps, it guarantees that you understand how your apps work top-to-bottom and end to end.

#### About the technology
Vue.js is one of the fastest growing and most popular open-source JavaScript frameworks around. Vue's meteoric success is found in its simplicity and short learning curve, but few resources are available to teach you how to test a Vue application effectively and efficiently. None of those resources are comprehensiveâ€”a blog post here, a chapter there. This book will put an end to your search!

#### About the book
Testing Vue.js Applications is a comprehensive guide to testing Vue components, methods, events, and output. Author Edd Yerburgh, creator of the Vue testing utility avoriaz, teaches you how to set up effective testing practices. You'll use the Jest framework to run tests for a Hacker News application built with Vue, Vuex and Vue Router. You'll especially appreciate the instantly-useful tips and best practices distilled from the author's extensive hands-on development experience.

#### What's inside
* Building and testing component output, method, and events
* Running unit tests, snapshot tests, and end to end tests in Jest
* Testing server-side rendering
* Testing Vuex and Vue-router
