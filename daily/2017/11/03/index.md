[![Flux Architecture](/assets/img/learning/packt/flux-architecture.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Adam Boduch (valid through 11/03 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Flux, Alt, Redux, Jest.

#### Publisher's Description
**Learn to build powerful and scalable applications with Flux, the architecture that serves billions of Facebook users every day**

Whilst React has become Facebook’s poster-child for clean, complex, and modern web development, it has quietly been underpinned by its simplicity. It’s just a view. The real beauty in React is actually the architectural pattern that handles data in and out of React applications: Flux. With Flux, you’re able to build data-rich applications that engage your users, and scale to meet every demand. It is a key part of the Facebook technology stack that serves billions of users every day.

This book will start by introducing the Flux pattern and help you get an understanding of what it is and how it works. After this, we’ll build real-world React applications that highlight the power and simplicity of Flux in action. Finally, we look at the landscape of Flux and explore the Alt and Redux libraries that make React and Flux developments easier.

Filled with fully-worked examples and code-first explanations, by the end of the book, you'll not only have a rock solid understanding of the architecture, but will be ready to implement Flux architecture in anger.

#### What You Will Learn
* Understand the Flux pattern and how it will impact your React applications
* Build real-world applications that rely on Flux
* Handle asynchronous actions in your application
* Implement immutable stores with Immutable.js
* Replace React.js with alternate View components such as jQuery and Handlebars
* Test and benchmark your Flux architecture using Jest—Facebook’s enhancement of the Jasmine library

#### About the Author

[![Nginx: From Beginner to Pro](/assets/img/learning/apress/nginx-from-beginner-to-pro.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484216576)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484216576) by Rahul Soni. This book covers Nginx.

#### Publisher's Description
* Written by an author who has moved from IIS/Apache to Nginx, this book is practical and filled with step-by-step instructions to make your time with Nginx as straightforward as possible
* Covers CentOS, Ubuntu, and Mac usage
* Teaches in a practical and real-world way

Teaches you to start up Nginx and quickly take your expertise to a level where you can comfortably work with various aspects of the web server and make informed design decisions for your web farm. Nginx powers more than 40% of the top 1000 websites and is among the handful of web servers that can handle more than 10K simultaneous connections. It has some features which are simply unparalleled.

Nginx: From Beginner to Pro teaches the Nginx server in a practical way. Frequently, it is found that web administrators struggle to fix the skill set gaps that happen due to a platform change. Migration from IIS & Apache becomes tedious at best. The book is targeted toward real-world administrators who would want to get up to speed as soon as possible and make good, informed design decisions. First you will set up Nginx and understand the architectural nuances. Then you will learn how to scale out, secure, monitor and troubleshoot the web server. Once you are fully comfortable with Nginx, you will start learning about migrating applications (or its part) from IIS or Apache web servers. Finally, you will learn to troubleshoot and maintain your Nginx professionally.

Written by an author who has gone through the rough phase while moving from IIS/Apache to Nginx, this book is practical and filled with step-by-step instructions to make your time with Nginx as straightforward as possible. 

#### What You Will Learn 
* Install and set up Nginx on CentOS, Ubuntu & Mac.
* Understand Nginx modules and compiling Nginx with appropriate modules.
* Learn about basic configuration and architecture along with hosting nuances.
* Load balance Nginx and use it as a highly available web platform.
* Monitor traffic and automate common administrative tasks.
* Use scripts to perform routine checks for health issues.
* Implement security and authentication in Nginx.
* Learn how and what to migrate from IIS & Apache web servers.

#### Who This Book Is For 
Provides a crisp background of Nginx and then gears towards technical and practical topics. You need to know HTTP protocol, and have basic knowledge of Linux and networking concepts. The target audience is web administrators who would like to learn the finer nuances of Nginx, or map their existing skillset from IIS or Apache.

[![The Java Module System](/assets/img/learning/manning/java-module-system-the.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Nicolai Parlog. This book covers Java Module System, Java 9.

#### Publisher's Description
Java's much-awaited "Project Jigsaw" is finally here! Java 9 will include a built-in modularity framework, and The Java Module System is your guide to discovering it. In this new book, you'll learn how the module system improves reliability and maintainability and can be used to reduce tight coupling of system components. You'll then discover how to build, compile, and run your own fully modular applications with best practices and expert techniques. Along the way, you'll also explore Java 9's compatibility challenges and how to migrate your application to the module system.

#### About the technology
Experienced developers understand the benefits of strong encapsulation; when two components can interact only through the interfaces you define, you reduce the chance that you'll introduce hidden dependencies and unwanted tight coupling into your code. The Java Module System, aka "Project Jigsaw", gives Java developers the ability to define and enforce modularity without an outside framework. A modular application allows a team to more-safely approach large projects and produce cleaner code with superior run-time stability. The benefits don't just stop there however, the shift to modules also promises reliable configuration - allowing individual modules to declare their dependencies on other modules, along with allowing both the developers and JVM the same vision of the running application; changing how you develop with Java for the better!

#### What's inside
* The anatomy of a modular Java app
* Building modules from source to JAR
* Compiling both single and multiple modules
* Debugging your finished applications

#### About the reader
If you are a developer who has experience working with Java, then this book is perfect for you.

#### About the author
Nicolai Parlog is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it, who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun. He is the editor of SitePoint's Java channel, blogs about software development on codefx.org, and is a long-tail contributor to several open source projects. The best way to get in touch is via Twitter.

This book also explains functional programming in Java, working with collections, and more.

#### About the technology
The release of Java 9 builds on what made Java 8 so exciting. In addition to Java 8's lambdas and streams, Java 9 adds a host of new features of its own. It includes new library features to support reactive programming, which give you new ways of thinking about programming and writing code that is easier to read and maintain.
