#### Publisher's Description
**Harness the latest features of MongoDB 3 with this collection of 80 recipes – from managing cloud platforms to app development, this book is a vital resource**

MongoDB is a high-performance and feature-rich NoSQL database that forms the backbone of the systems that power many different organizations – it’s easy to see why it’s the most popular NoSQL database on the market. Packed with many features that have become essential for many different types of software professionals and incredibly easy to use, this cookbook contains many solutions to the everyday challenges of MongoDB, as well as guidance on effective techniques to extend your skills and capabilities.

This book starts with how to initialize the server in three different modes with various configurations. You will then be introduced to programming language drivers in both Java and Python. A new feature in MongoDB 3 is that you can connect to a single node using Python, set to make MongoDB even more popular with anyone working with Python. You will then learn a range of further topics including advanced query operations, monitoring and backup using MMS, as well as some very useful administration recipes including SCRAM-SHA-1 Authentication. Beyond that, you will also find recipes on cloud deployment, including guidance on how to work with Docker containers alongside MongoDB, integrating the database with Hadoop, and tips for improving developer productivity.

[![React in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/react-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Mark Thomas. This book covers React, Redux, React Native, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
React is an open source JavaScript framework that lets you quickly create user interfaces for web applications. This highly-performant tool implements a one-way data flow model, which means communication is much more top-down than side-to- side. It also utilizes a component-focused design, so you can build large, robust web applications that scale well with users and developers. Reasoning about an interface or application written with React ends up being much easier because it decreases overall complexity for developers working with it. Large and small companies alike are using React for highly-visible, high-impact applications including Facebook.com, Netflix.com, and Airbnb.com.

#### About the book
React in Action introduces front-end developers to the React framework and related tools. This clearly written, example-rich book begins by introducing you to React, diving into some of the fundamental ideas in React, and working with components. You'll work your way from "raw" React (no transpilation, no syntactic helpers) towards JSX, and from basic static components to ones that are dynamic and interactive. In the second section, you'll explore the different ways that data works in React as well as learning more about components. You'll discover core topics like lifecycle methods, data flow, forms, higher-order components, and testing. In the last section, you'll explore React application architecture with Redux, server-side rendering, and even dabble in React Native. You'll also find several useful appendices covering related topics like React tooling and ecosystem.

#### What's inside
* Building a simple social networking sample app (Letters Social)
* Learning about the fundamentals of React
* Dynamically fetching data from a remote JSON API
* Building React applications with modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond)
* Implementing a routing system from scratch using components
* Utilizing server-side rendering for React applications
* Testing React applications
* Implementing application architecture using Redux

#### About the reader
