Beginners wanting to learn ethical hacking alongside a modular object oriented programming language. 

#### About the Author
**Sanjib Sinha** writes stories and codes - not in the same order always. He started with C# and .NET framework and won the Microsoft Community Contributor Award in 2011. Later the Open Source Software movement attracted him and he became Linux, PHP and Python enthusiast, specializing in and working on White Hat Ethical Hacking.As a beginner he had to struggled a lot to find an easier way to learn coding. No one told him that coding is like writing - imagining a concept and making it a reality with the help of words and symbols. All through his books he has tried to help the beginners from their own perspectives.
