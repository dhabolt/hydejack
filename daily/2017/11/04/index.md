[![Python Geospatial Development, Third Edition](/assets/img/learning/packt/python-geospatial-development-third-edition.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Erik Westra (valid through 11/04 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Geospatial Development, GIS, Python 3, GeoDjango, PostGIS, Mapnik.


#### Publisher's Description
**Develop sophisticated mapping applications from scratch using Python 3 tools for geospatial development**

Geospatial development links your data to locations on the surface of the Earth. Writing geospatial programs involves tasks such as grouping data by location, storing and analyzing large amounts of spatial information, performing complex geospatial calculations, and drawing colorful interactive maps. In order to do this well, you’ll need appropriate tools and techniques, as well as a thorough understanding of geospatial concepts such as map projections, datums, and coordinate systems.

This book provides an overview of the major geospatial concepts, data sources, and toolkits. It starts by showing you how to store and access spatial data using Python, how to perform a range of spatial calculations, and how to store spatial data in a database. Further on, the book teaches you how to build your own slippy map interface within a web application, and finishes with the detailed construction of a geospatial data editor using the GeoDjango framework.

By the end of this book, you will be able to confidently use Python to write your own geospatial applications ranging from quick, one-off utilities to sophisticated web-based applications using maps and other geospatial data.

#### What You Will Learn
* Access, manipulate, and display geospatial data from within your Python programs
* Master the core geospatial concepts of location, distance, units, projections, and datums
* Read and write geospatial data in both vector and raster format
* Perform complex, real-world geospatial calculations using Python
* Store and access geospatial information in a database
* Use points, lines, and polygons within your Python programs
* Convert geospatial data into attractive maps using Python-based tools
* Build complete web-based mapping applications using Python

[![ASP.NET Core MVC Testing Fundamentals](/assets/img/learning/pluralsight/asp-net-core-mvc-testing-fundamentals.png)](https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course)
[Free Pluralsight course (through Nov. 7)](https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course) by Jason Roberts. This course covers ASP.NET Core MVC, xUnit.net, Selenium, Moq.

#### Publisher's Description
ASP.NET Core MVC is the latest evolution of .NET web programming. In this course, you'll learn how to create automated tests to cover the different parts of your ASP.NET Core MVC application to help find errors before they make it to production.

No one likes the stress of emergencies caused by errors in code that have been released to production, especially if these errors happen early in the morning and require emergency fixes. Automated tests help check the application is working as expected, and reduces the likelihood of errors making it to the production environment. Fewer production errors mean happier end users, development teams, and business owners.

In this course, ASP.NET Core MVC Testing Fundamentals, you'll learn how to create automated tests for your ASP.NET Core MVC application, including model, controller, and automated UI tests. First, you'll dive into getting started with xUnit.net, and how to specifically test your model. Next, you'll explore how to isolate parts of your code base by using mock objects and the Moq library for .NET Core. Finally, you'll cover how to automate the browser to create functional UI tests.

By the end of this course, you'll have the knowledge to create automated unit, integration, and UI tests for your ASP.NET Core MVC application. Additionally, you'll know how to execute these tests to verify the correctness of your application, and help ensure errors do not make it to production.

#### Publisher's Description
* The first book presenting the SMACK stack
* A practical guide teaching how to incorporate big data
* Covers the full stack of big data architecture, discussing the practical benefits of each technology

Learn how to integrate full-stack open source big data architecture and to choose the correct technology—Scala/Spark, Mesos, Akka, Cassandra, and Kafka—in every layer. 

Big data architecture is becoming a requirement for many different enterprises. So far, however, the focus has largely been on collecting, aggregating, and crunching large data sets in a timely manner. In many cases now, organizations need more than one paradigm to perform efficient analyses.

Big Data SMACK explains each of the full-stack technologies and, more importantly, how to best integrate them. It provides detailed coverage of the practical benefits of these technologies and incorporates real-world examples in every situation. This book focuses on the problems and scenarios solved by the architecture, as well as the solutions provided by every technology. It covers the six main concepts of big data architecture and how integrate, replace, and reinforce every layer:
* The language: Scala
* The engine: Spark (SQL, MLib, Streaming, GraphX)
* The container: Mesos, Docker
* The view: Akka
* The storage: Cassandra
* The message broker: Kafka

#### What You Will Learn:
* Make big data architecture without using complex Greek letter architectures
* Build a cheap but effective cluster infrastructure
* Make queries, reports, and graphs that business demands
* Manage and exploit unstructured and No-SQL data sources
* Use tools to monitor the performance of your architecture
* Integrate all technologies and decide which ones replace and which ones reinforce

#### Who This Book Is For:
Developers, data architects, and data scientists looking to integrate the most successful big data open stack architecture and to choose the correct technology in every layer.
