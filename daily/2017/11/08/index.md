[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221693) by Stacy Simpkins. This book covers SharePoint 2016.

#### Publisher's Description
* Takes you step by step through the process of building your own SharePoint farm in a home lab setting, so you can create your own testing and learning environment, whether you're a developer or administrator
* Learn to build a windows domain and join servers to it, whether SharePoint or another technology such as Exchange Server
* Written by a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert in SharePoint

This book is a step-by-step guide to building your own SharePoint farm in a home lab setting. Learn how to build a windows domain and then join servers into the domain in order to create your own testing and learning environment. After you get the domain stood up, where you go from there is up to you.  This book will help you learn how to spin up SharePoint in a least privileged fashion.  This isn’t strictly a SharePoint book, though. For example, if you’re not a SharePoint professional and are just looking to create a working windows domain for other purposes; the home-lab domain that you’ll create will work great for Exam preparation for non-SharePoint purposes.  You could even use it for learning how to install Exchange Server.  After all, it’s your Home Lab domain. In this book you will build your home-lab domain and you’ll have a great place for learning how to administer SharePoint and develop SharePoint Apps.  Here are just some of the tasks you’ll complete in easy to follow exercises:
* Create a windows domain and a certificate authority, so that you can run SharePoint on SSL
* Join servers to the domain and configure other technology on the member servers as needed
* Install SQL Server, and correctly partition the server in accordance with best practices
* Install and configure a SharePoint farm
* Spin up Host Named Site Collections (HNSC’s)
* Install and configure Visual Studio

#### Who This Book Is For:
This book is suitable for both developers and administrators. No technical knowledge is assumed beyond a general familiarity with computers and computing terminology. The resulting domain will be suitable for both IT and developer testing needs.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jamie Duncan, John Osborne. This book covers OpenShift.

#### Publisher's Description
Enterprise infrastructure has a lot of moving parts, and it's your job to keep everything running smoothly. OpenShift, an innovative enterprise infrastructure management system from RedHat, radically simplifies the day-to-day operation of deploying and maintaining large-scale applications. The OpenShift container management platform (CMP) uses Docker, Kubernetes, and other container-oriented technologies to ease cluster management, scaling, and upgrades. By providing an intuitive shell over established technologies, OpenShift gives you the reliability and stability you need with the ease of use you want.

#### About the book
OpenShift in Action teaches you how to set up and manage container-based infrastructure using OpenShift. You'll explore the core concepts of containers from the ground up: from the kernel all the way through the application. You'll use OpenShift workflows to deploy and scale container applications across multiple nodes. You'll also deploy and troubleshoot a microservices-oriented OpenShift web app and learn to perform rolling application and a base-image upgrades. Along the way, you'll also discover techniques for handling persistent storage and best practices for security and other fundamental tasks.

[![CoreOS in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/CoreOS-in-Action.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Matt Bailey. This book covers CoreOS, Linux, Docker.

#### Publisher's Description
CoreOS in Action is a clear tutorial for deploying container-based systems on CoreOS Container Linux.

#### About the technology
Traditional Linux server distributions include every component required for anything you might be hosting, most of which you don't need if you've containerized your apps and services. CoreOS Container Linux is a bare-bones distro with only the essential bits needed to run containers like Docker. Container Linux is a fast, secure base layer for any container-centric distributed application, including microservices. And say goodbye to patch scheduling; when Container Linux needs an update, you just hot-swap the whole OS.

#### About the book
CoreOS in Action is a clear tutorial for deploying container-based systems on CoreOS Container Linux. Inside, you'll follow along with examples that teach you to set up CoreOS on both private and cloud systems, and to practice common sense monitoring and upgrade techniques with real code. You'll also explore important container-aware application designs, including microservices, web, and Big Data examples with real-world use cases to put your learning into perspective.

#### What's inside
* Handling scaling and failures gracefully
* Container-driven application designs
* Cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployment
* Smart logging and backup practices

#### About the reader
Written for readers familiar with Linux and the basics of Docker.
