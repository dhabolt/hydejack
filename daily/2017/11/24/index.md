[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Mario Casciaro, Luciano Mammino (valid through 11/24 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Node.js 6, Universal JavaScript, Callback Pattern, Module System, Revealing Module Pattern, Observer Pattern, Babel, Factory Pattern, Revealing Constructor Pattern, Proxy Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Adapter Pattern, Strategy Pattern, State Pattern, Template Pattern, Command Pattern, Webpack, React, Publish/Subscribe Pattern.

#### Publisher's Description
**Get the best out of Node.js by mastering its most powerful components and patterns to create modular and scalable applications with ease**

Node.js is a massively popular software platform that lets you use JavaScript to easily create scalable server-side applications. It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.

In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the "Node.js way" of dealing with design and coding decisions.

The book kicks off by exploring the basics of Node.js describing it's asynchronous single-threaded architecture and the main design patterns. It then shows you how to master the asynchronous control flow patterns,and the stream component and it culminates into a detailed list of Node.js implementations of the most common design patterns as well as some specific design patterns that are exclusive to the Node.js world.Lastly, it dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal Javascript, and scalability' and it's meant to conclude the journey by giving the reader all the necessary concepts to be able to build an enterprise grade application using Node.js.

#### What You Will Learn
* Design and implement a series of server-side JavaScript patterns so you understand why and when to apply them in different use case scenarios
* Become comfortable with writing asynchronous code by leveraging constructs such as callbacks, promises, generators and the async-await syntax
* Identify the most important concerns and apply unique tricks to achieve higher scalability and modularity in your Node.js application
* Untangle your modules by organizing and connecting them coherently
* Reuse well-known techniques to solve common design and coding issues
* Explore the latest trends in Universal JavaScript, learn how to write code that runs on both Node.js and the browser and leverage React and its ecosystem to implement universal applications

#### About the Authors
**Mario Casciaro** is a software engineer and entrepreneur, passionate about technology, science and open source knowledge. Mario graduated with a master's degree in software engineering and started his professional career at IBM where he worked for several years on different enterprise products such as Tivoli Endpoint Manager, Cognos Insight, and SalesConnect. Next, he moved to D4H Technologies, a growing SaaS company, to lead the development of a new bleeding-edge product for managing emergency operations in real time. Currently, Mario is the co-founder and CEO of Sponsorama.com, a platform to help online projects raise funds through corporate sponsorship.

**Luciano Mammino** is a software engineer born in 1987, the same year that the Nintendo released Super Mario Bros in Europe, which by chance is his favorite video-game. He started coding at the age of 12 using his father's old Intel 386, provided only with the DOS operating system and the qBasic interpreter.

After a master's degree in computer science he developed his programming skills mostly as a web developer working mainly as freelancer for companies and startups all around Italy. After a start-up parenthesis of 3 years as CTO and co-founder of Sbaam.com in Italy and in Ireland, he decided to relocate in Dublin to work as senior PHP engineer at Smartbox.

He loves developing open source libraries and working with frameworks such as Symfony and Express. He is convinced that the JavaScript fame is still at the very beginning and that this technology will have a huge impact in the future of most of the web-and mobile-related technologies. For this reason, he spends most of his free time improving his knowledge of JavaScript and playing with Node.js.

[![Beginning SQL Queries, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/apress/beginning-sql-queries-second-edition.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484219546)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484219546) by Clare Churcher. This book covers SQL.

#### Publisher's Description
**Apply the right operations to the  right problem to generate the right results, every time**

* Broad appeal – Developers, web designers, database administrators, even power users working with Microsoft Access need to know something of SQL
* Clarity – Author's previous book, **Beginning Database Design**, has established her as someone who writes with exceptional clarity about database topics
* Succinctness – Beginning Queries with SQL does not waste readers' time. It covers the ground in far fewer pages than do competing books

Get started on mastering the one language binding the entire database industry. That language is SQL, and how it works is must-have knowledge for anyone involved with relational databases, and surprisingly also for anyone involved with NoSQL databases. SQL is universally used in querying and reporting on large data sets in order to generate knowledge to drive business decisions.

Good knowledge of SQL is crucial to anyone working with databases, because it is with SQL that you retrieve data, manipulate data, and generate business results. Every relational database supports SQL for its expressiveness in writing queries underlying reports and business intelligence dashboards. Knowing how to write good queries is the foundation for all work done in SQL, and it is a foundation that Clare Churcher's book, Beginning SQL Queries, 2nd Edition, lays well.


#### What You Will Learn
* Write simple queries to extract data from a single table
* Combine data from many tables into one business result using set operations
* Translate natural language questions into database queries providing meaningful information to the business
* Avoid errors associated with duplicated and null values
* Summarize data with amazing ease using the newly-added feature of window functions
* Tackle tricky queries with confidence that you are generating correct results
* Investigate and understand the effects of indexes on the efficiency of queries

#### Who This Book Is For
**Beginning SQL Queries, 2nd Edition** is aimed at intelligent laypeople who need to extract information from a database, and at developers and other IT professionals who are new to SQL. The book is especially useful for business intelligence analysts who must ask more complex questions of their database than their GUI–based reporting software supports. Such people might be business owners wanting to target specific customers, scientists and students needing to extract subsets of their research data, or end users wanting to make the best use of databases for their clubs and societies.

#### About the Author
**Clare Churcher** (B.Sc. (Hons), Ph.D.(physics)) has designed several databases for a variety of large and small projects. She is a currently a Senior Lecturer and Development Manager for Applied IT at Tai Poutini Polytechnic.   She spent two years as a Business Analyst for a large international software development company, and prior to that nearly two decades as a senior faculty member of the Applied Computing Group at Lincoln University where her teaching included Analysis and Design, Database, and Programming papers. In 2006 she won a Lincoln University Excellence in Teaching Award.  She has supervised over 70 undergraduate projects designing databases for small projects.
