[![Secure by Design](/assets/img/learning/manning/secure-by-design.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Dan Bergh Johnsson, Daniel Deogun, Daniel Sawano. This book covers Application Security, Domain-Driven Design.

#### Publisher's Description
As a developer, you need to build software in a secure way. But you can't spend all your time focusing on security. The answer is to use good design principles, tools, and mindsets that make security an implicit result - it's secure by design. Then secure-by-design becomes a guiding principle in how you build your software, from code to architecture. This begins by understanding designs and patterns that promote security so they become easy to apply in your day-to-day work. This way, you end up with securely-built software that avoids a majority of the most common security vulnerabilities. And best of all, it liberates your mind from security and lets you focus on developing features.

Secure by Design teaches developers how to use design to drive security in software development. This book is full of patterns, best practices, and mindsets that you can directly apply to your real world development. You'll also learn to spot weaknesses in legacy code and how to address them. You'll start by gaining an understanding of security as a vital concern and not simply a feature, and how good design promotes security. A real-life case study shows how shallow design caused a severe loss of money. Then you'll dive into practical ways of designing your code to avoid security flaws. You'll see how to use concrete code constructs that have profound effect on security - for example, immutability, validation, domain primitives, and error handling. Additional topics include how to secure your design through tests, using your delivery pipeline, how to do integration between systems, and how insights from cloud thinking support security. The final part of the book compares different architectures from a security perspective and puts concepts from previous chapters to work. In particular, you'll learn what to do in a legacy codebase, how to handle a monolith, and what to do when building a microservice architecture.

#### What's inside
* Using good design to create secure software
* Applying design concepts in real-world cases
* Spotting hidden security problems
* Assessing security by identifying design patterns
* Understanding benefits and limitations of secure-by-design
* Securing legacy, monoliths, and microservice architectures

#### About the reader
Readers should have some experience in Java, C#/.NET, or similar language.

#### About the authors
**Dan Bergh Johnsson**, **Daniel Deogun**, and **Daniel Sawano** have collectively been working with security and development for several decades. They are developers at heart and understand that security is often a side-concern. They have also evolved work habits that enable them to develop systems in a way that promotes security, while focusing on high-quality design habits - something that is easier for developers to keep in mind during their daily work. All three are established international speakers and often present at conferences on topics regarding high-quality development as well as security.
