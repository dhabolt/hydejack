#### Publisher's Description
**Create powerful applications for the modern web**

Writing code is about striking a balance between maintainability and productivity—how quickly you can write it against how much more you have to write in the future. This is a guide to doing just that by combining the impressive capabilities of ASP.NET Core and Angular 2. It shows you how to successfully manage an API and use it to support and power a dynamic single-page application.

We'll show you how to construct your data model and manage routing and redirects before wrapping it up and styling it, all with the help of ASP.NET and Angular 2. You'll also learn how to optimize your application for SEO, check and secure any vulnerabilities, implement a viable authentication mechanism and, last but not least, use the proper tools and strategies for successful deployment. From readable URIs to OData retrieval and authentication patterns, we'll make sure you have all the technical knowledge you need and, more importantly, bring it all together so you can focus on what's important: a high-quality application that performs for users.

#### What You Will Learn
* Find out how ASP.NET Core’s and Angular 2’s features perfectly complement each other
* Learn how to set up the resources you need and configure the MVC 6 interface
* Handle requests and actions using server-side and client-side Routing

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by David Nicolette with foreword by George Dinwiddie. This book covers Software Metrics.

#### Publisher's Description
Software Development Metrics is a handbook for anyone who needs to track and guide software development and delivery at the team level, such as project managers and team leads. New development practices, including "agile" methodologies like Scrum, have redefined which measurements are most meaningful and under what conditions you can benefit from them. This practical book identifies key characteristics of organizational structure, process models, and development methods so that you can select the appropriate metrics for your team. It describes the uses, mechanics, and common abuses of a number of metrics that are useful for steering and for monitoring process improvement. The insights and techniques in this book are based entirely on field experience.

#### About the book
When driving a car, you are less likely to speed, run out of gas, or suffer engine failure because of the measurements the car reports to you about its condition. Development teams, too, are less likely to fail if they are measuring the parameters that matter to the success of their projects. This book shows you how.

Software Development Metrics teaches you how to gather, analyze, and effectively use the metrics that define your organizational structure, process models, and development methods. The insights and examples in this book are based entirely on field experience. You'll learn practical techniques like building tools to track key metrics and developing data-based early warning systems. Along the way, you'll learn which metrics align with different development practices, including traditional and adaptive methods.

#### What's inside
* Identify the metrics most valuable for your team and process
* Differentiate "improvement" from "change"
* Learn to interpret and apply the data you gather
* Common pitfalls and anti-patterns

#### About the reader
No formal experience with developing or applying metrics is assumed.

#### About the author
**Dave Nicolette** is an organizational transformation consultant, team coach, and trainer. Dave is active in the agile and lean software communities.

#### Publisher's Description
As a developer, you may inherit projects built on existing codebases with design patterns, usage assumptions, infrastructure, and tooling from another time and another team. Fortunately, there are ways to breathe new life into legacy projects so you can maintain, improve, and scale them without fighting their limitations.

**Re-Engineering Legacy Software** is an experience-driven guide to revitalizing inherited projects. It covers refactoring, quality metrics, toolchain and workflow, continuous integration, infrastructure automation, and organizational culture. You'll learn techniques for introducing dependency injection for code modularity, quantitatively measuring quality, and automating infrastructure. You'll also develop practical processes for deciding whether to rewrite or refactor, organizing teams, and convincing management that quality matters. Core topics include deciphering and modularizing awkward code structures, integrating and automating tests, replacing outdated build systems, and using tools like Vagrant and Ansible for infrastructure automation.

#### What's inside
* Refactoring legacy codebases
* Continuous inspection and integration
* Automating legacy infrastructure
* New tests for old code
* Modularizing monolithic projects

#### About the reader
This book is written for developers and team leads comfortable with an OO language like Java or C#.
