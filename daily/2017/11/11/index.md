[![Mastering .NET Machine Learning](/assets/img/learning/packt/mastering-net-machine-learning.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Jamie Dixon (valid through 11/11 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Machine Learning, .NET Framework, F#, Linear Regression, Math.NET, Accord.NET, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbors, Unsupervised Learning, Neural Networks, IoT.

#### Publisher's Description
**Master the art of machine learning with .NET and gain insight into real-world applications**

.Net is one of the widely used platforms for developing applications. With the meteoric rise of Machine learning, developers are now keen on finding out how can they make their .Net applications smarter. Also, .NET developers are interested into moving into the world of devices and how to apply machine learning techniques to, well, machines.

This book is packed with real-world examples to easily use machine learning techniques in your business applications. You will begin with introduction to F# and prepare yourselves for machine learning using .NET framework. You will be writing a simple linear regression model using an example which predicts sales of a product. Forming a base with the regression model, you will start using machine learning libraries available in .NET framework such as Math.NET, Numl.NET and Accord.NET with the help of a sample application. You will then move on to writing multiple linear regressions and logistic regressions.

You will learn what is open data and the awesomeness of type providers. Next, you are going to address some of the issues that we have been glossing over so far and take a deep dive into obtaining, cleaning, and organizing our data. You will compare the utility of building a KNN and Naive Bayes model to achieve best possible results.

Implementation of Kmeans and PCA using Accord.NET and Numl.NET libraries is covered with the help of an example application. We will then look at many of issues confronting creating real-world machine learning models like overfitting and how to combat them using confusion matrixes, scaling, normalization, and feature selection. You will now enter into the world of Neural Networks and move your line of business application to a hybrid scientific application. After you have covered all the above machine learning models, you will see how to deal with very large datasets using MBrace and how to deploy machine learning models to Internet of Thing (IoT) devices so that the machine can learn and adapt on the fly.

#### What You Will Learn
* Write your own machine learning applications and experiments using the latest .NET framework, including .NET Core 1.0
* Set up your business application to start using machine learning.
* Accurately predict the future using regressions.
* Discover hidden patterns using decision trees.
* Acquire, prepare, and combine datasets to drive insights.
* Optimize business throughput using Bayes Classifier.
* Discover (more) hidden patterns using KNN and Naïve Bayes.
* Discover (even more) hidden patterns using K-Means and PCA.
* Use Neural Networks to improve business decision making while using the latest ASP.NET technologies.
* Explore “Big Data”, distributed computing, and how to deploy machine learning models to IoT devices – making machines self-learning and adapting
* Along the way, learn about Open Data, Bing maps, and MBrace

[![.NET Development Using the Compiler API](/assets/img/learning/apress/net-development-using-the-compiler-api.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221105)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221105) by Jason Bock. This book covers .NET Framework, .NET Compiler Platform.

#### Publisher's Description
* First book to describe recent significant changes to the Compiler API and demonstrate how .NET developers can use it to create compelling applications
* This concise book provides a valuable roadmap to this new development environment
* Teaches how to generate, compile, and execute code for a number of scenarios

This is the first book to describe the recent significant changes to the .NET compilation process and demonstrate how .NET developers can use the new Compiler API to create compelling applications. As an open source compiler, the Compiler API now makes its code available for anyone to use. In this book, you’ll get a concise, focused view of this tremendous resource for developers, who can now use any part of the platform implementation to their advantage in analyzing applications, improving code generation, and providing enforceable patterns, all under an OSS model.

You will learn how to analyze your code for defects in a fast, clean manner never available before. You’ll work with solutions and projects to provide automatic refactoring, and you’ll discover how you can generate code dynamically to provide application implementations at runtime

Having the Compiler API available opens a number of doors for .NET developers that were either simply not there before, or difficult to achieve. However, the API is vast, and this concise book provides a valuable roadmap to this new development environment.

#### What You Will Learn:
* Understand how to generate, compile, and execute code for a number of scenarios
* How to create diagnostics and refactoring to help developers enforce conventions and design idioms
* Experiment with the compiler code base and see what can be done to influence the inner workings of the compilation pipeline

#### Who This Book Is For
Experienced .NET developers, but detailed compiler knowledge is not necessary.

### <a name="new1"></a>[Adopting Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/tvmelixir/adopting-elixir)
[![Adopting Elixir](/assets/img/learning/pragmatic/adopting-elixir.jpg)](https://pragprog.com/book/tvmelixir/adopting-elixir)
[Adopting Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/tvmelixir/adopting-elixir) From Concept to Production by Ben Marx, José Valim, Bruce Tate. This book covers Elixir.

#### Publisher's Description
Adoption is more than programming. Elixir is an exciting new language, but to successfully get your application from start to finish, you’re going to need to know more than just the language. You need the case studies and strategies in this book. Learn the best practices for the whole life of your application, from design and team-building, to managing stakeholders, to deployment and monitoring. Go beyond the syntax and the tools to learn the techniques you need to develop your Elixir application from concept to production.

#### About this Title
Learn real-life strategies from the people who built Elixir and use it successfully at scale. See how Ben Marx and Bleacher Report maintain one of the highest-traffic Elixir applications by selling the concept to management and delivering on that promise. Find out how Bruce Tate and icanmakeitbetter hire and train Elixir engineers, and the techniques they’ve employed to design and ensure code consistency since Elixir’s early days. Explore customer challenges in deploying and monitoring distributed applications with Elixir creator José Valim and Plataformatec.

Make a business case and build a team before you finish your first prototype. Once you’re in development, form strategies for organizing your code and learning the constraints of the runtime and ecosystem. Convince stakeholders, both business and technical, about the value they can expect. Prepare to make the critical early decisions that will shape your application for years to come. Manage your deployment with all of the knobs and gauges that good DevOps teams demand. Decide between the many options available for deployment, and how to best prepare yourself for the challenges of running a production application.

This book picks up where most Elixir books leave off. It won’t teach you to program Elixir, or any of its tools. Instead, it guides you through the broader landscape and shows you a holistic approach to adopting the language.

#### What You Need
This book works with any version of Elixir.

#### About the Authors
**Ben Marx** is a lead developer at Bleacher Report and one of the first to use Elixir at scale.

**José Valim** is the creator of Elixir and a founder at Plataformatec.

**Bruce Tate** is the CTO of icanmakeitbetter.com, and the author of Programming Phoenix, Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, and more than ten other books.
