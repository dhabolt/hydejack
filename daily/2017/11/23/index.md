### <a name="manning-daily-3"></a><small>50% off</small> [Xamarin in Action](https://www.manning.com/dotd) Creating native cross-platform mobile apps
[![Xamarin in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/xamarin-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jim Bennett. This book covers Xamarin, C#, IOS, Android, MVVM.

#### Publisher's Description
Xamarin is a toolset that allows you to write native mobile apps in C# and run them on both iOS and Android devices. What makes Xamarin stand out from other cross-platform tools is that it gives you the ability to share large portions of code across these two platforms while still letting you write native apps that can take full advantage of the device and OS features specific to each platform. And since Xamarin was recently acquired by Microsoft, you can be sure the ecosystem will continue to grow - Xamarin has become a hugely important part of Microsoft's "any developer, any platform" mantra.

Xamarin in Action teaches you how to build Xamarin apps on iOS and Android from scratch while maximizing code re-use. This layer-by-layer guide starts by showing you the MVVM design pattern and explaining how it increases code sharing. Next, you'll start building an app from the ground up. You'll learn all the different layers inside a well written Xamarin app and discover how most of your code can be shared between iOS and Android. You'll look at how this code sharing can be best designed to allow unit testing of your business layer as well as your UI logic. Then you'll dig in to code that can't be shared, like user interface code that's device specific. Finally, you'll learn how to take your app from final code to a tested and deployed version on the relevant store. By the end, you'll be able to build a high quality production-ready Xamarin app on iOS and Android from scratch with a high level of code reuse.

#### What's inside
* Understand MVVM and how it maximizes code reuse and testability
* Build a mobile app from rough design through final deployable product
* Creating cross platform model and UI logic layers
* Build device specific UIs for iOS and Android
* Test apps through unit and automated UI testing
* Prepare apps for publication with user tracking and crash analytics

#### About the reader
This book is for C# developers with a few months through many years of experience who want to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android using the language and toolset they already know.

#### About the author
**Jim Bennett** is a Xamarin MVP, Microsoft MVP, Xamarin Certified Developer and an active community member. He's also a frequent speaker at events all around the world, including Xamarin user groups and Xamarin and Microsoft conferences. He regularly blogs about Xamarin development at https://jimbobbennett.io.
