#### About the Author
**Richard Boddington** commenced general policing with the London Metropolitan Police in 1968 and joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1971, later serving as a chief inspector in the Special Branch. In 1980, Richard moved to Australia and worked as a desk officer and case officer with the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. He later worked in several federal and state government agencies, including the Western Australia Department of Treasury and Finance, as a senior intelligence officer.

In 2008, he commenced developing and coordinating information security and digital forensics undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Murdoch University, where he was responsible for the creation of a digital forensic and information security degree offering. He provided a unique online virtual digital forensics unit for postgraduate students at the University of Western Australia in 2014.

Between 1991 and 2015, Richard was a security analyst and digital forensic practitioner, providing independent consultancy services for legal practitioners and organizations requiring independent digital forensic examinations and reports. This included analyzing case evidence in criminal and civil cases heard at Magistrate, District and Commonwealth Courts. His work included the compilation of digital forensic reports and testifying as an expert witness on complex technical matters to assist the jury in understanding digital evidence presented during trial.

Recent forensic examinations undertaken by him include analyzing digital evidence recovered from computers, mobile phones, and other digital devices and then preparing expert testimony relating to a broad range of criminal and civil cases, including:
* Child pornography and child exploitation
* Cyberstalking
* Aggravated burglary and false imprisonment
* Analysis of CCTV video digital evidence of assault and rape cases
* Alleged homicide, suicide, and other crimes of violence
* Bomb threats
* Family law disputes and Australian Vietnamese Relief Organization (AVRO) breaches
* Workers' compensation disputes
* Suspected forgery or manipulation of digital video and mobile phone evidence
* Industrial espionage and sabotage and intellectual property theft

Since 2015, Richard has continued his digital forensics examinations on behalf of TSW Analytical Pty Ltd in Western Australia, where he now heads the Digital Forensics and Data Recovery Team.

He is also the General Manager for Research and Training at eReveal Technologies Pty Ltd (TSW Global Company) and is responsible for designing and coordinating online digital forensics, multimedia forensics, and e-discovery training courses for a broad range of organizations.

Richard is presently developing online digital forensics and e-discovery academic postgraduate course for the evolving Institute for Applied Forensic Science, associated with TSW Analytical, as part of broader postgraduate forensic course offerings in Australasia and overseas.

In 2010, Richard authored two digital forensics chapters in Digital Business Security Development: Management Technologies. He has also written a number of journal articles on the validation of digital evidence, his ongoing research area.

In 2015, he authored an online video cast series, [Emerging Forensic Tools for Locating and Analyzing Digital Evidence](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/emerging-forensic-tools/9781466695917/), on behalf of IGI Global Video Lecture E-Access Videos.

#### Publisher's Description
* Build flexible applications that respond fast to changing business needs
* Take advantage of unconventional but productive uses of dynamic SQL
* Protect your data from attack through best-practices in your implementations

This book is an introduction and deep-dive into the many uses of dynamic SQL in Microsoft SQL Server. Dynamic SQL is key to large-scale searching based upon user-entered criteria. It’s also useful in generating value-lists, in dynamic pivoting of data for business intelligence reporting, and for customizing database objects and querying their structure.

Executing dynamic SQL is at the heart of applications such as business intelligence dashboards that need to be fluid and respond instantly to changing user needs as those users explore their data and view the results. Yet dynamic SQL is feared by many due to concerns over SQL injection attacks. Reading Dynamic SQL: Applications, Performance, and Security is your opportunity to learn and master an often misunderstood feature, including security and SQL injection.

All aspects of security relevant to dynamic SQL are discussed in this book. You will learn many ways to save time and develop code more efficiently, and you will practice directly with security scenarios that threaten companies around the world every day. Dynamic SQL: Applications, Performance, and Security helps you bring the productivity and user-satisfaction of flexible and responsive applications to your organization safely and securely. Your organization’s increased ability to respond to rapidly changing business scenarios will build competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded and competitive global marketplace.

* Discusses many applications of dynamic SQL, both simple and complex.
* Explains each example with demos that can be run at home and on your laptop.
* Helps you to identify when dynamic SQL can offer superior performance.
* Pays attention to security and best practices to ensure safety of your data.

#### What You Will Learn ##
* Build flexible applications that respond fast to changing business needs.
* Take advantage of unconventional but productive uses of dynamic SQL.
* Protect your data from attack through best-practices in your implementations.
* Know about SQL Injection and be confident in your defenses against it
* Run at high performance by optimizing dynamic SQL in your applications.
* Troubleshoot and debug dynamic SQL to ensure correct results.

#### Who This Book is For
Dynamic SQL: Applications, Performance, and Security is for developers and database administrators looking to hone and build their T-SQL coding skills. The book is ideal for advanced users wanting to plumb the depths of application flexibility and troubleshoot performance issues involving dynamic SQL. The book is also ideal for beginners wanting to learn what dynamic SQL is about and how it can help them deliver competitive advantage to their organizations.

#### About the Author
**Edward Pollack** is a database administrator with over 15 years of professional experience in database design, optimization, server hardware, and public speaking.  He has spoken at dozens of SQL Saturday events, as well as at 24 Hours of PASS and the PASS Summit.  His passion for sharing knowledge also leads him to create and coordinate a SQL Saturday in New York’s Capital Region, where he has lived for the past 19 years.  His long experience computing has lead Edward through many different fields of study, but data storage, security, and optimization has been the one area that has always been of most interest; it will continue to be so for as long as people continue to care about their data.

#### Publisher's Description
Docker in Motion teaches you how to create and manage container-hosted applications in Docker. With over 2 hours of hands-on, practical video lessons, you'll learn the ins and outs of Docker and discover how to apply what you've learned to your own day-to-day development. Starting with an overview of Docker, you'll dive into the commands and techniques you'll need for running and managing containers, creating, modifying, saving and uploading Docker images from scratch, running and building multiple containers with Docker Compose, and more.

#### About the subject
Docker creates sandboxed environments, called containers, that isolate your applications from the underlying infrastructure, making them much easier to deploy, migrate, scale, and remove. Each Docker container includes the application and all its dependencies in a single deployable package. Docker has rapidly become a nearly universal part of IT infrastructure in millions of Linux and cloud-based deployments worldwide, including big shops like eBay and Lyft. It's time to join them!

#### About the technology
The idea behind Docker is simple. Create a tiny virtual environment, called a container, that holds just your application and its dependencies. The Docker engine uses the host operating system to build and account for these containers. They are easy to install, manage, and remove. Applications running inside containers share resources, making their footprints small.

#### What's inside
* Packaging containers for deployment
* Installing, managing, and removing containers
* Working with Docker images
* Distributing with DockerHub
