You'll find brand-new coverage of agile testing for the enterprise, distributed teams, mobile/embedded systems, regulated environments, data warehouse/BI systems, and DevOps practices.

You'll come away understanding
* How to clarify testing activities within the team
* Ways to collaborate with business experts to identify valuable features and deliver the right capabilities
* How to design automated tests for superior reliability and easier maintenance
* How agile team members can improve and expand their testing skills

#### Publisher's Description
**Unleash Python and take your small readers on an adventurous ride through the world of programming**

Kids are always the most fast-paced and enthusiastic learners, and are naturally willing to build stuff that looks like magic at the end (when it works!). Programming can be one such magic. Being able to write a program that works helps them feel they've really achieved something. Kids today are very tech-savvy and cannot wait to enter the fast-paced digital world.

Because Python is one of the most popular languages and has a syntax that is quite simple to understand, even kids are eager to use it as a stepping stone to learning programming languages.

This book will cover projects that are simple and fun, and teach kids how to write Python code that works.

The book will teach the basics of Python programming, installation, and so on and then will move on to projects. A total of three projects, with each and every step explained carefully, without any assumption of previous experience.

#### What You Will Learn
* Start fiddling with Python's variables, build functions and interact with users
* Build your own calculator using the Math Library
* Train Python to make logical decisions
* Work with moving 2D objects on-screen
* Understand the Pygame Library and build your very own game!
* Write a cool program to manage inventories in your backpack

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Kamil Nicieja with foreword by Gojko Adzic. This book covers Specification by Example, Gherkin, Cucumber.

#### Publisher's Description
Specification by Example is a collaborative approach to defining and illustrating software requirements using concrete examples. Gherkin is a business-readable DSL that you use to describe software's behavior as executable test cases that are easy for non-technical folks to understand. Together, Specification by Example and Gherkin offer programmers, designers, and managers an inclusive environment for clear communication, discovering requirements, and building a documentation system.

Writing Great Specifications is an example-rich tutorial that teaches you how to write good Gherkin specification documents that take advantage of Specification by Example's benefits. The book begins by giving you introductions to Specification by Example and Gherkin as well as the big picture of how they work together. After a crash course in Gherkin, you'll go in-depth learning to write the text layer of executable specifications in Gherkin in a clear, understandable, and concise manner. Non-engineers will learn how to make essential contributions to testing without having to learn to write testing code. Engineers and testers will find it helpful in striking a stronger chord with non-technical audiences through automated specifications.
