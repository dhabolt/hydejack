[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Minko Gechev with foreword by Misko Hevery (valid through 11/08 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Angular 2 RC4.

#### Publisher's Description
**Build SEO-friendly, high-performance single-page applications with Angular 2**

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that makes building web applications easier. It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with under-performance, portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness, and complexity at scale.

Angular 2 changes that.

It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. "Switching to Angular 2" is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular 2 and will help you transition in to the brave new world of Angular 2.

We'll start with an overview which sets the changes of the framework in context with version 1.x. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so we can take advantage of Angular 2 in its native, statically-typed environment. We'll look at the new change-detection method in detail, how Directives and Components change how you create websites with Angular, the new Angular 2 router, and much more.

By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular 2 applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer.

#### What You Will Learn
* Understand the changes made from Angular 1.x with side-by-side code samples to help demystify the Angular 2 learning curve
* Start working with Angular 2's new method of implementing directives
* Use TypeScript to write modern, powerful Angular 2 applications
* Dig in to the change-detection method, and other architectural changes to make sure you know what's going on under the hood of Angular 2.
* Get to work with the new router in Angular 2
* Use the new features of Angular 2 including pipes, or the updated features such as forms, services, and the DI module
* Master server-side rendering in Angular 2 to keep your new applications SEO friendly

Designers and design team members need to think about more than just aesthetics. How do you handle short attention spans. How does your design encourage users to engage, browse, or buy?

The idea is to deepen your understanding of why people react in the ways they do. After reading the book, you'll be ready to make your work more psychologically friendly, engaging, and persuasive.

#### Publisher's Description
For large groups of users, mobile devices have replaced the desktop as their primary computing platform. As an application developer, you have to think mobile-first to make your customers happy.

Fortunately, building great user interfaces is a skill you can learn, even if you're a heads-down desktop or web coder.

Usability Matters: Mobile-first UX for developers and other accidental designers gives you practical advice and guidance creating attractive, elegant, and useful user interfaces for native and web-based mobile apps. You'll start by learning six dimensions of a great app experience. Then you'll be guided through practical concepts for creating those great experiences for your users. Following expertly-presented patterns, examples, and checklists, you'll learn how to recognize good (and not-so-good) UX in your own designs and master the techniques that separate the best apps from the rest of the pack.
