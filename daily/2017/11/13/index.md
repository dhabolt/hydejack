**Harness the power of Apple Pay in your iOS apps and integrate it with global payment gateways**

Apple Pay, one of the most talked about offerings of the latest iOS 9 release, is a digital wallet and electronic payment system developed by Apple Inc. Paying in stores or within apps has never been easier or safer. Gone are the days of searching for your wallet, and the wasted moments finding the right card! Now you can use your credit cards and rewards cards with just a touch.

Whether you are a brand new iOS app developer or a seasoned expert, this book arms you with the necessary skills to successfully implement Apple Pay. We start off by teaching you how to obtain the certificates necessary to encrypt customers’ payment information. We will use Xcode and Objective C for the interface and Node.js for server side code. You will then learn how to determine whether the customer can use Apple Pay, and how to create payment requests. You will come to grips with designing a payment-processor program to interact with the payment gateway. Finally, we take a look at a business-focused view of Apple Pay protocols and classes.

By the end of this book, you will be able to build a fully functional Apple Pay-integrated iOS app.

* Shows how to organize your team for moving to responsive
* Make your static site beautiful on any device

Redesign your static website into a modern, fully responsive website. As the usage of mobile devices of all shapes and sizes increases exponentially every year, and dominates the manner in which many users access the web, it is now imperative for any business to have a responsive website that adapts seamlessly to any screen size and resolution — a change that will impact not only your designs but the way you build your site.

Moving to Responsive Web Design shows you how to convert fixed grids, previously built on absolute units such as pixels, into fluid ones, based on relative units such as percentages or ems. You will also learn to plan how your designs and patterns will adapt across various breakpoints, and how to approach the challenge of responsive images.

The prospect of converting an existing site into responsive design, when you don’t have all the time in the world and your resources are already outstretched, can be daunting, but with this book and the right tools you can tame the scope of the project from the start and find the time for you and your team to work on making your site enjoyable on any device. Moving to Responsive Web Design is full of ideas and examples of how you can more easily plan, design, develop, and release, your responsively redesigned site.
* Provides ways of finding time in your hectic schedule to complete a project that is truly important 
* Helps you to scope a responsive redesign project so it’s achievable with the resources you have available
* Provides examples of how other teams have solved some of the most common problems 

#### What You Will Learn
* Find the time in your busy schedule to redesign your site.
* Engage the entire team in the plan, design and development process.
* Use your resources in clever and efficient ways.
* Focus on reusability to save your team time and money.

[![Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js](/assets/img/learning/manning/serverless-apps-with-node-and-claudia-js-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Slobodan Stojanovic, Aleksandar Simovic. This book covers Node.js, Claudia.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Microservices, Amazon Alexa.

#### Publisher's Description
First the buzzwords: Serverless computing. AWS Lambda. API Gateway. Node.js. Microservices. Cloud-hosted functions. That's an impressive-sounding list, but what's the point? Beyond the buzzwords are real benefits like fast design-to-deployment times, low hosting costs, and efficient scaling and application management, along with real technologies that deliver them.

Serverless Apps with Node and Claudia.js walks you through building serverless apps on AWS using JavaScript. Inside, you'll create a full project designed to help you understand and apply general serverless design principles and concepts. Along the way, you'll also discover what Claudia brings to the table as you build and deploy a scalable event-based serverless application that is fully integrated with AWS services including Lambda and API Gateway. You'll learn to simplify the design and development process so you can focus on getting your application deployed as fast as possible without sacrificing quality. Plus, you'll learn how to migrate your existing Express apps to serverless!

#### About the technology
Serverless computing services like AWS Lambda and API Gateway can be tedious to set up, aren't designed to work well with JavaScript and Node, and most of the quirks and gotchas aren't well documented. A new generation of serverless tools, including Claudia.js, make it radically easier to set up serverless web applications so you can focus on what your app does instead of meddling with infrastructure configuration and deployment. Claudia doesn't alter your project layout or abstract away the core AWS services; it just makes it easier to get started with them!

[Kafka in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kafka-in-action)  by Dylan Scott. This book covers Apache Kafka, Streaming Data.

#### Publisher's Description
In systems that handle big data, streaming data, or fast data, it's important to get your data pipelines right. Apache Kafka is a wicked-fast distributed streaming platform that operates as more than just a persistent log or a flexible message queue. With Kafka, you can build the powerful real-time data processing pipelines required by modern distributed systems. Kafka in Action is a fast-paced introduction to every aspect of working with Kafka you need to really reap its benefits.

#### About the technology
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for logging and streaming data between services or applications. With Kafka, it's easy to build applications that can act on or react to data streams as they flow through your system. Operational data monitoring, large scale message processing, website activity tracking, log aggregation, and more are all possible with Kafka. Open-source, easily scalable, durable when demand gets heavy, and fast - Kafka is perfect for developers who need total control of the data flowing into and through their applications. The demand for Kafka developers is at an all-time high, as companies like LinkedIn, The New York Times, and Netflix, are relying on Kafka where fast data is essential.

#### About the book
Kafka in Action is a practical, hands-on guide to building Kafka-based data pipelines. Filled with real-world use cases and scenarios, this book probes Kafka's most common use cases, ranging from simple logging through managing streaming data systems for message routing, analytics, and more. Starting with an overview of Kafka's core concepts, you'll immediately learn how to set up and execute basic data movement tasks and how to record and consume streaming data. As you move through the examples in this book, you'll learn the skills you need to work in a Kafka focused team with the ability to handle both developer and admin based tasks. At the end of this book, you'll be more than ready to dig into even more advanced Kafka topics on your own, and happily able to use Kafka in your day-to-day workflow.

#### What's inside
* Understanding Kafka's concepts
* Implementing Kafka as a message queue
* Setting up and executing basic ETL tasks
* Recording and consuming streaming data
* Working with Kafka producers and consumers from Java applications
* Using Kafka as part of a large data project team
