Create 3D printable models that can help students from kindergarten through grad school learn math, physics, botany, chemistry, engineering and more. 

This book shows parents and teachers how to use the models inside as starting points for 3D printable explorations. Students can start with these models and vary them for their own explorations. Unlike other sets of models that can just be scaled, these models have the science built-in to allow for more insight into the fundamental concepts.

Each of the eight topics is designed to be customized by you to create a wide range of projects suitable for science fairs, extra credit, or classroom demonstrations. Science fair project suggestions and extensive "where to learn more" resources are included, too. You will add another dimension to your textbook understanding of science.

#### Publisher's Description
Irresistible APIs provides step-by-step guidance for designing APIs that reflect an application's core business value, delight the developers who use them, and will stand the test of time. In it, business product managers and developers learn how to treat an API as a first-class product.

#### About the technology
It takes a village to deliver an irresistible web API. Business stakeholders look for an API that works side-by-side with the main product to enhance the experience for customers. Project managers require easy integration with other products or ways for customers to interact with your system. And, developers need APIs to consistently interoperate with external systems. The trick is getting the whole village together. This book shows you how.

In it, you'll learn how to capture an application's core business value and extend it with an API that will delight the developers who use it. Thinking about APIs from the business point of view, while also considering the end-user experience, encourages you to explore both sides of the design process and learn some successful biz-to-dev communication patterns. Along the way, you'll start to view your APIs as part of your product's core value instead of just an add-on.

#### What's inside
* Design-driven development
* Developing meaningful use cases
* API guiding principles
* How to recognize successful APIs

#### About the reader
Written for all members of an API design team, regardless of technical level.

#### Publisher's Description
Aurelia in Action teaches you how to build fantastic single page applications with the Aurelia framework. Starting with a complete overview of Aurelia and what makes it a great SPA framework you'll dive straight into building your first Aurelia application. Far more than an Aurelia reference, this book teaches you to design and build production-quality single page web applications. You'll then dig deep into templating and data binding the Aurelia way. You'll also learn about routing, working with HTTP, and extending Aurelia. Finishing everything off, you'll tune, secure, and deploy your finished SPAs, giving you everything you need to create modern web apps for a modern world.

#### About the technology
Aurelia is a web framework that makes it much easier to create single page web applications. Aurelia was written with ES6, so modern JavaScript design principles are baked in from the ground level. Adopting a Rails-like convention-over-configuration mindset, Aurelia makes it a snap to start even complex projects, because the most common design principles and best practices are implemented in new projects by default. And because it features components at the forefront, it's easy to break up your work so teams can be instantly productive. Built by working web developers, Aurelia is pluggable, customizable, and one of the most dev-friendly front-end frameworks you'll ever use!

#### What's inside

[![Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/pragmatic/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks-second-edition.jpg)](https://pragprog.com/book/pwrdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks-second-edition)
[Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, Second Edition](https://pragprog.com/book/pwrdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks-second-edition) A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement by Luc Perkins, Jim Wilson, Eric Redmond. This book covers NoSQL, Redis, Neo4j, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Postgres, DynamoDB.

#### Publisher's Description
Data is getting bigger and more complex by the day, and so are your choices in handling it. Explore some of the most cutting-edge databases available—from traditional relational databases to newer NoSQL approaches—and make informed decisions about challenging data storage problems. This is the only comprehensive guide to the world of NoSQL databases, with in-depth practical and conceptual introductions to seven different technologies: Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Postgres, and DynamoDB. This second edition includes a new chapter on DynamoDB and updated content for each chapter.

#### About this Title
While relational databases such as MySQL remain as relevant as ever, the alternative, NoSQL paradigm has opened up new horizons in performance and scalability and changed the way we approach data-centric problems. This book presents the essential concepts behind each database alongside hands-on examples that make each technology come alive.

With each database, tackle a real-world problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. Along the way, explore five database models—relational, key/value, columnar, document, and graph—from the perspective of challenges faced by real applications. Learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J, build a cluster of HBase servers using cloud services such as Amazon's Elastic MapReduce, and more. This new edition brings a brand new chapter on DynamoDB, updated code samples and exercises, and a more up-to-date account of each database's feature set.

Whether you're a programmer building the next big thing, a data scientist seeking solutions to thorny problems, or a technology enthusiast venturing into new territory, you will find something to inspire you in this book.

#### What You Need
You'll need a *nix shell (Mac OS or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), Java 6 (or greater), and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater). Each chapter will list the downloads required for that database.
