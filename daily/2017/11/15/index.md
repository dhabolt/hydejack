[![Learning Predictive Analytics with Python](/assets/img/learning/packt/learning-predictive-analytics-with-python.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Ashish Kumar with foreword by Pradeep Gulipalli (valid through 11/15 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Predictive Analytics, Python.

#### Publisher's Description
**Gain practical insights into predictive modelling by implementing Predictive Analytics algorithms on public datasets with Python**

Social Media and the Internet of Things have resulted in an avalanche of data. Data is powerful but not in its raw form - It needs to be processed and modeled, and Python is one of the most robust tools out there to do so. It has an array of packages for predictive modeling and a suite of IDEs to choose from. Learning to predict who would win, lose, buy, lie, or die with Python is an indispensable skill set to have in this data age.

This book is your guide to getting started with Predictive Analytics using Python. You will see how to process data and make predictive models from it. We balance both statistical and mathematical concepts, and implement them in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy.

You'll start by getting an understanding of the basics of predictive modeling, then you will see how to cleanse your data of impurities and get it ready it for predictive modeling. You will also learn more about the best predictive modeling algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. Finally, you will see the best practices in predictive modeling, as well as the different applications of predictive modeling in the modern world.

#### What You Will Learn
* Understand the statistical and mathematical concepts behind Predictive Analytics algorithms and implement Predictive Analytics algorithms using Python libraries
* Analyze the result parameters arising from the implementation of Predictive Analytics algorithms
* Write Python modules/functions from scratch to execute segments or the whole of these algorithms
* Recognize and mitigate various contingencies and issues related to the implementation of Predictive Analytics algorithms
* Get to know various methods of importing, cleaning, sub-setting, merging, joining, concatenating, exploring, grouping, and plotting data with pandas and numpy
* Create dummy datasets and simple mathematical simulations using the Python numpy and pandas libraries
* Understand the best practices while handling datasets in Python and creating predictive models out of them

[![Building a Comprehensive IT Security Program](/assets/img/learning/apress/building-a-comprehensive-it-security-program.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484220528)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484220528) by Jeremy Wittkop. This book covers Information Security.

#### Publisher's Description
* Organizations continue to struggle with information security programs
* This book will demystify a lot of concepts around building effective information security programs
* This book will introduce concepts, ideas, and strategies that have been proven to be successful, but have not yet been published to a wide audience
* Organizations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for the intelligence and thought leadership that will be provided in the book
* The book will cite historical examples and put the current situation in context in a way that it can be explained simply to people who may not be familiar with information security concepts

This book explains the ongoing war between private business and cyber criminals, state-sponsored attackers, terrorists, and hacktivist groups. Further, it explores the risks posed by trusted employees that put critical information at risk through malice, negligence, or simply making a mistake. It clarifies the historical context of the current situation as it relates to cybersecurity, the challenges facing private business, and the fundamental changes organizations can make to better protect themselves. The problems we face are difficult, but they are not hopeless.

Cybercrime continues to grow at an astounding rate. With constant coverage of cyber-attacks in the media, there is no shortage of awareness of increasing threats. Budgets have increased and executives are implementing stronger defenses. Nonetheless, breaches continue to increase in frequency and scope.

Building a Comprehensive IT Security Program shares why organizations continue to fail to secure their critical information assets and explains the internal and external adversaries facing organizations today. This book supplies the necessary knowledge and skills to protect organizations better in the future by implementing a comprehensive approach to security.

Jeremy Wittkop's security expertise and critical experience provides insights into topics such as:
* Who is attempting to steal information and why?
* What are critical information assets?
* How are effective programs built?
* How is stolen information capitalized?
* How do we shift the paradigm to better protect our organizations?
* How we can make the cyber world safer for everyone to do business?

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Dylan Scott. This book covers Apache Kafka, Streaming Data.

#### Publisher's Description
In systems that handle big data, streaming data, or fast data, it's important to get your data pipelines right. Apache Kafka is a wicked-fast distributed streaming platform that operates as more than just a persistent log or a flexible message queue. With Kafka, you can build the powerful real-time data processing pipelines required by modern distributed systems. Kafka in Action is a fast-paced introduction to every aspect of working with Kafka you need to really reap its benefits.

#### About the technology
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for logging and streaming data between services or applications. With Kafka, it's easy to build applications that can act on or react to data streams as they flow through your system. Operational data monitoring, large scale message processing, website activity tracking, log aggregation, and more are all possible with Kafka. Open-source, easily scalable, durable when demand gets heavy, and fast - Kafka is perfect for developers who need total control of the data flowing into and through their applications. The demand for Kafka developers is at an all-time high, as companies like LinkedIn, The New York Times, and Netflix, are relying on Kafka where fast data is essential.

#### About the book
Kafka in Action is a practical, hands-on guide to building Kafka-based data pipelines. Filled with real-world use cases and scenarios, this book probes Kafka's most common use cases, ranging from simple logging through managing streaming data systems for message routing, analytics, and more. Starting with an overview of Kafka's core concepts, you'll immediately learn how to set up and execute basic data movement tasks and how to record and consume streaming data. As you move through the examples in this book, you'll learn the skills you need to work in a Kafka focused team with the ability to handle both developer and admin based tasks. At the end of this book, you'll be more than ready to dig into even more advanced Kafka topics on your own, and happily able to use Kafka in your day-to-day workflow.
