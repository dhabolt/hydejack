[![Web Development with Django Cookbook, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/packt/web-development-with-django-cookbook-second-edition.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Aidas Bendoraitis (valid through 11/19 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Django 1.8, Haystack, Django CMS, Python.

#### Publisher's Description
**Over 90 practical recipes to help you create scalable websites using the Django 1.8 framework**

Django is a web framework that was designed to strike a balance between rapid web development and high performance. It has the capacity to handle applications with high levels of user traffic and interaction, and can integrate with massive databases on the backend, constantly collecting and processing data in real time.

Through this book, you'll discover that collecting data from different sources and providing it to others in different formats isn't as difficult as you thought. It follows a task-based approach to guide you through all the web development processes using the Django framework. We’ll start by setting up the virtual environment for a Django project and configuring it. Then you’ll learn to write reusable pieces of code for your models and find out how to manage database schema changes using South migrations. After that, we’ll take you through working with forms and views to enter and list data. With practical examples on using templates and JavaScript together, you will discover how to create the best user experience. In the final chapters, you'll be introduced to some programming and debugging tricks and finally, you will be shown how to test and deploy the project to a remote dedicated server.

By the end of this book, you will have a good understanding of the new features added to Django 1.8 and be an expert at web development processes.

#### What You Will Learn
* Get started with the basic configuration necessary to start any Django project
* Build a database structure out of reusable model mixins
* Manage forms and views and get to know some useful patterns that are used to create them
* Create handy template filters and tags that you can reuse in every project
* Integrate your own functionality into the Django CMS
* Manage hierarchical structures with MPTT
* Import data from local sources and external web services as well as exporting your data to third parties
* Implement a multilingual search with Haystack
* Test and deploy your project efficiently

[![How to Use Objects](/assets/img/learning/informit/how-to-use-objects.jpg)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=O7eD6EjdUAQ&mid=24808&murl=http://www.informit.com/deals/)
[$19.99 InformIT eBook](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=O7eD6EjdUAQ&mid=24808&murl=http://www.informit.com/deals/) by Holger Gast. This book covers Object-Oriented Programming, Observer Pattern, Composite Pattern, Visitor Pattern, Interpreter Pattern, Stack Machines, Liskov Substitution Principal, Unit Testing, Model-View-Controller Pattern, State Machines, Single Responsibility Principal.

#### Publisher's Description
While most developers today use object-oriented languages, the full power of objects is available only to those with a deep understanding of the object paradigm. How to Use Objects will help you gain that understanding, so you can write code that works exceptionally well in the real world.

Author Holger Gast focuses on the concepts that have repeatedly proven most valuable and shows how to render those concepts in concrete code. Rather than settling for minimal examples, he explores crucial intricacies, clarifies easily misunderstood ideas, and helps you avoid subtle errors that could have disastrous consequences.

Gast addresses the technical aspects of working with languages, libraries, and frameworks, as well as the strategic decisions associated with patterns, contracts, design, and system architecture. He explains the roles of individual objects in a complete application, how they react to events and fulfill service requests, and how to transform excellent designs into excellent code. Using practical examples based on Eclipse, he also shows how tools can help you work more efficiently, save you time, and sometimes even write high-quality code for you.

Gast writes for developers who have at least basic experience: those who’ve finished an introductory programming course, a university computer science curriculum, or a first or second job assignment.

#### Coverage includes
* Understanding what a professionally designed object really looks like
* Writing code that reflects your true intentions—and testing to make sure it does
* Applying language idioms and connotations to write more readable and maintainable code
* Using design-by-contract to write code that consistently does what it’s supposed to do
* Coding and architecting effective event-driven software
* Separating model and view, and avoiding common mistakes
* Mastering strategies and patterns for efficient, flexible design
* Ensuring predictable object collaboration via responsibility-driven design

#### About the Author
**Holger Gast** graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Tübingen, Germany, in 2000, and received a Ph.D. with a dissertation on type systems for programming languages in 2005 (Tübingen). As a post doctoral fellow, he worked on formal correctness proofs for software and finished his Habilitation for Computer Science in 2012 (Tübingen).

Since 2000, he has been teaching in the area of software engineering at different levels of the computer science curriculum, starting from introductory programming courses to lectures on software design and architecture. His other interests include scientific databases for the humanities and the model-driven construction of data-driven web applications.
