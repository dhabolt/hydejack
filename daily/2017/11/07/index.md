[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Rick Boyer, Kyle Mew (valid through 11/07 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Android Marshmallow, Android Studio IDE, OpenGL ES, Volley, Geofencing, Google Maps, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Speech Recognition.

#### Publisher's Description
The Android OS has the largest installation base of any operating system in the world; there has never been a better time to learn Android development to write your own applications, or to make your own contributions to the open source community!

This "cookbook" will make it easy for you to jump to a topic of interest and get what you need to implement the feature in your own application. If you are new to Android and learn best by "doing," then this book will provide many topics of interest.

Starting with the basics of Android development, we move on to more advanced concepts, and we'll guide you through common tasks developers struggle to solve. The first few chapters cover the basics including Activities, Layouts, Widgets, and the Menu. From there, we cover fragments and data storage (including SQLite), device sensors, the camera, and GPS. Then we move on more advanced topics such as graphics and animation (including OpenGL), multi-threading with AsyncTask, and Internet functionality with Volley. We'll also demonstrate Google Maps and Google Cloud Messaging (also known as Push Notifications) using the Google API Library.

Finally, we'll take a look at several online services designed especially for Android development. Take your application big-time with full Internet web services without having to become a server admin by leveraging the power of Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers.

#### What You Will Learn
* Along with Marshmallow, get hands-on working with Google's new Android Studio IDE
* Develop applications using the latest Android framework while maintaining backward-compatibility with the support library
* Master Android programming best practices from the recipes

[![Redux in Motion](/assets/img/learning/manning/redux-in-motion-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's Video](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Thomas Tuts. This video covers Redux, React.

#### Publisher's Description
See it. Do it. Learn it! Redux in Motion introduces you to the powerful Redux library through high-quality video-based lessons and built-in exercises, so you can put what you learn into practice.

Redux in Motion guides you through a complete Redux-based web app, start to finish. You'll learn the core principles of actions, reducer functions, and stores that make state management predictable.

[![Redux in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/redux-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Marc Garreau, Will Faurot. This book covers Redux, React, JavaScript.

#### Publisher's Description
The "state" of a typical web application - the representation of its data at any given time - is stored in multiple data stores that must be individually monitored and maintained. The Redux JavaScript library consolidates state in a single object, radically simplifying one of the largest sources of bugs. Whether you're passing data through several layers of components or sharing and syncing data between unrelated parts of the app, Redux makes state management a breeze. Redux promotes predictability, testability, and the ability to debug your dynamic applications, letting you focus on building great apps. Redux is most closely associated with React.js, although you can use it with just about any framework, including Angular, Backbone, and Vue.js.

With Redux in Action, you'll discover how to integrate Redux into your React application and development environment. Starting by building a basic task management application, you'll dive into the Redux workflow, asynchronous actions, and the Redux developer tools. As you move through the practical examples inside, you'll also learn how to prepare data for components, write custom middleware, and optimize for performance. With the insights you glean from the experience of authors Marc Garreau and Will Faurot, you'll be more than confident in your ability to solve your state management woes with Redux, and focus on developing the apps you need to!

#### What's inside
* Building with Redux and React
* Writing custom Redux middleware
* Handling complex side-effects using sagas
* Enforcing data integrity by normalizing data
* Unit testing a React and Redux application

#### About the reader
Written for web developers comfortable with JavaScript and ES6, as well as experience using React.

#### About the authors
**Marc Garreau** has architected and executed half a dozen unique client-side applications leveraging Redux for state management. 

**Will Faurot** is experienced in equal parts production Redux, and mentoring Redux developers of all skill levels.
