### <a name="packt"></a><small>Free</small> [Linux Networking Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
![Linux Networking Cookbook](/assets/img/learning/packt/linux-networking-cookbook.jpg)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Gregory Boyce (valid through 9/16 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Linux.

#### Publisher's Description
Linux can be configured as a networked workstation, a DNS server, a mail server, a firewall, a gateway router, and many other things. These are all part of administration tasks, hence network administration is one of the main tasks of Linux system administration. By knowing how to configure system network interfaces in a reliable and optimal manner, Linux administrators can deploy and configure several network services including file, web, mail, and servers while working in large enterprise environments.

Starting with a simple Linux router that passes traffic between two private networks, you will see how to enable NAT on the router in order to allow Internet access from the network, and will also enable DHCP on the network to ease configuration of client systems. You will then move on to configuring your own DNS server on your local network using bind9 and tying it into your DHCP server to allow automatic configuration of local hostnames. You will then future enable your network by setting up IPv6 via tunnel providers.

Moving on, we’ll configure Samba to centralize authentication for your network services; we will also configure Linux client to leverage it for authentication, and set up a RADIUS server that uses the directory server for authentication.

Toward the end, you will have a network with a number of services running on it, and will implement monitoring in order to detect problems as they occur.

#### What You Will Learn
* Route an IPv6 netblock to your local network
* Modify your named instance to support setting hostnames for your IPv6 addresses
* Use SSH for remote console access
* Configure NGINX with TLS
* Secure XMPP with TLS
* Leverage iptables6 to firewall your IPv6 traffic
* Configure Samba as an Active Directory compatible directory service

#### Authors

![Cisco Networks](/assets/img/learning/apress/cisco-networks.png)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484208601) by Christopher Carthern, William Wilson, Noel Rivera, Richard Bedwell. This book covers Cisco IOS, Cisco ASA, CCENT, CCNA, CCNP, Cisco NX-OS.

#### Publisher's Description
This book is a concise one-stop desk reference and synopsis of basic knowledge and skills for Cisco certification prep. For beginning and experienced network engineers tasked with building LAN, WAN, and data center connections, this book lays out clear directions for installing, configuring, and troubleshooting networks with Cisco devices. The full range of certification topics is covered, including all aspects of IOS, NX-OS, and ASA software. The emphasis throughout is on solving the real-world challenges engineers face in configuring network devices, rather than on exhaustive descriptions of hardware features.

This practical desk companion doubles as a comprehensive overview of the basic knowledge and skills needed by CCENT, CCNA, and CCNP exam takers. It distills a comprehensive library of cheat sheets, lab configurations, and advanced commands that the authors assembled as senior network engineers for the benefit of junior engineers they train, mentor on the job, and prepare for Cisco certification exams. Prior familiarity with Cisco routing and switching is desirable but not necessary, as Chris Carthern, Dr. Will Wilson, Noel Rivera, and Richard Bedwell start their book with a review of the basics of configuring routers and switches. All the more advanced chapters have labs and exercises to reinforce the concepts learned.

This book differentiates itself from other Cisco books on the market by approaching network security from a hacker’s perspective. Not only does it provide network security recommendations but it teaches you how to use black-hat tools such as oclHashcat, Loki, Burp Suite, Scapy, Metasploit, and Kali to actually test the security concepts learned.

#### Readers of Cisco Networks will learn:
* How to configure Cisco switches, routers, and data center devices in typical corporate network architectures
* The skills and knowledge needed to pass Cisco CCENT, CCNA, and CCNP certification exams
* How to set up and configure at-home labs using virtual machines and lab exercises in the book to practice advanced Cisco commands
* How to implement networks of Cisco devices supporting WAN, LAN, and data center configurations
* How to implement secure network configurations and configure the Cisco ASA firewall
* How to use black-hat tools and network penetration techniques to test the security of your network

![The Java Module System](/assets/img/learning/manning/java-module-system-the.png)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Nicolai Parlog. This book covers Java Module System, Java.


#### Publisher's Description
Java's much-awaited "Project Jigsaw" is finally here! Java 9 will include a built-in modularity framework, and The Java Module System is your guide to discovering it. In this new book, you'll learn how the module system improves reliability and maintainability and can be used to reduce tight coupling of system components. You'll then discover how to build, compile, and run your own fully modular applications with best practices and expert techniques. Along the way, you'll also explore Java 9's compatibility challenges and how to migrate your application to the module system.

#### About the technology
Experienced developers understand the benefits of strong encapsulation; when two components can interact only through the interfaces you define, you reduce the chance that you'll introduce hidden dependencies and unwanted tight coupling into your code. The Java Module System, aka "Project Jigsaw", gives Java developers the ability to define and enforce modularity without an outside framework. A modular application allows a team to more-safely approach large projects and produce cleaner code with superior run-time stability. The benefits don't just stop there however, the shift to modules also promises reliable configuration - allowing individual modules to declare their dependencies on other modules, along with allowing both the developers and JVM the same vision of the running application; changing how you develop with Java for the better!

#### What's inside
* The anatomy of a modular Java app
* Building modules from source to JAR
* Compiling both single and multiple modules
* Debugging your finished applications

#### About the reader
If you are a developer who has experience working with Java, then this book is perfect for you.

#### About the author
Nicolai Parlog is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it, who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun. He is the editor of SitePoint's Java channel, blogs about software development on codefx.org, and is a long-tail contributor to several open source projects. The best way to get in touch is via Twitter.
