### <small>Free</small> [C# Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
![C# Programming Cookbook](/assets/img/learning/packt/csharp-programming-cookbook.png)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Dirk Strauss (valid through 9/13 at 19:00 EST). This book covers C#.
#### Publisher's Description
During your application development workflow, there is always a moment when you need to get out of a tight spot. Through a recipe-based approach, this book will help you overcome common programming problems and get your applications ready to face the modern world.

We start with C# 6, giving you hands-on experience with the new language features. Next, we work through the tasks that you perform on a daily basis such as working with strings, generics, and lots more. Gradually, we move on to more advanced topics such as the concept of object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, reactive extensions, and code contracts.

You will learn responsive high performance programming in C# and how to create applications with Azure. Next, we will review the choices available when choosing a source control solution. At the end of the book, we will show you how to create secure and robust code, and will help you ramp up your skills when using the new version of C# 6 and Visual Studio.

#### What You Will Learn

* Write better and less code to achieve the same result as in previous versions of C#.
* Generate tests from the Code Contracts for mission critical methods.
* Integrate code in Visual Studio with GitHub.
* Create a web application in Azure.
* Design and build a microservice architecture
* Demystify the Rx library using Reactive extensions
* Write high performing codes in C# and understanding multi-threading.
* Security and Debugging.
* Implement Code Contracts on code in Visual Studio.

### <small>50% off</small> [Microservices in Action](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
![Microservices in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/microservices-in-action-meap.png)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Morgan Bruce, Paulo Pereira. This book covers Microservices.
#### Publisher's Description
Microservices in Action is a practical book about building and deploying microservice-based applications. Written for developers and architects with a solid grasp of service-oriented development, it tackles the challenge of putting microservices into production. You'll begin with an in-depth overview of microservice design principles, building on your knowledge of traditional systems. Then, you'll start creating a reliable road to production. You'll explore examples using Kubernetes, Docker, and Google Container Engine as you learn to build clusters and maintain them after deployment. Throughout this rich, experience-driven book, you'll move through real-world use cases including a continuous delivery pipeline, production monitoring, and practical techniques for scaling and maintaining a healthy system.

#### About the technology
Most enterprise developers are comfortable with writing individual components or services as part of a larger application. In microservice systems, the benefits - and unique challenges - arise from the way these services are organized, deployed, and managed. Production-ready microservice applications rely on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, container engines like Docker, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Microservices change the dev process as well, maximizing the efficiency and independence of small teams. To be successful, developers, team leaders, and architects need to master both the implementation details and the big picture of how microservices work in a production environment.

#### What's inside
* Review of microservice architecture
* Building a delivery pipeline for microservices
* Monitoring your microservices applications
* Deploying with containers
* Written by authors with daily, hands-on experience

#### About the reader
Readers should be intermediate developers with some knowledge of enterprise application architecture. Familiarity with container systems like Docker and IaaS cloud like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean is helpful but not required.

#### About the authors
Morgan Bruce and Paulo A. Pereira have years of experience building distributed applications, with particular expertise in the high-stakes finance and identity verification industries. They work daily with microservices in a production environment using the tools and techniques presented in this book.

### [Linux in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/linux-in-action)
![Linux in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/linux-in-action-meap.png)
[Linux in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/linux-in-action) by David Clinton. This book covers Linux.
#### Publisher's Description
The Linux operating system powers millions of web servers, data centers, and application platforms worldwide. Whether you're pushing applications to a cloud system like AWS, building a twitter bot on a Raspberry Pi, or rescuing files from a crashed laptop, Linux is required knowledge. The good news is that the same Linux command set will work for you no matter where you're using it. The better news is that Linux skills have staying power, so what you learn about Linux now will probably still work in a decade or two. Bottom line? If you're a developer, administrator, or just a weekend hacker, you need to know your way around the Linux command line. Let's get started!

#### About the book
Linux in Action is a task-based tutorial that will give you the skills and deep understanding you'll need to administer a Linux-based system. This hands-on book guides you through real-world projects so you can practice as you learn. You'll learn critical techniques like virtualization, disaster recovery, infrastructure security, data backup, web servers, DevOps, and system troubleshooting. Plus, each chapter ends with a command-line review, list of security best practices, unfamiliar terms & definitions, and exercises to bring home the key takeaways!

#### What's inside
* Setting up a Linux environment suitable for safely experimenting with modern technologies
* Managing secure remote connectivity
* Securing a web server
* Building a system recovery device
* Securely sharing files within a local network and across the internet
* Creating a VPN to safely connect to a server
* Troubleshooting network and system performance issues
* Making automated and reliable backup solutions

#### About the reader
Readers should be comfortable working with the files, networks, and basic resources of a modern operating system.
