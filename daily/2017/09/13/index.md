![Solving Real World Problems with SQL Server 2016 Query Store](/assets/img/learning/pluralsight/solving-real-world-problems-with-sql-server-2016-query-store.png)
[Free Pluralsight course (one week)](https://learn.pluralsight.com/resource/free-course/free-weekly-course) by Gail Shaw. This book covers Query Store, Transact-SQL, SQL Server.

#### Publisher's Description
Poor database performance is a widespread problem, and as data volumes increase it's only going to get worse. Up until now, identifying the poorly performing queries was challenging and difficult. SQL Server 2016 introduced the Query Store, which automatically tracks query performance. In this course, Solving Real World Problems with SQL Server 2016 Query Store, you'll learn how to solve difficult query performance problems in an easier, more efficient way. This course will show how to identify query performance regressions using the Query Store, how to identify queries using the most resources, and how to track the overall resource consumption at the database level. It'll also show some advanced uses of Query Store, such as upgrade tests and load tests. By the end this course, you’ll be able to use Query Store to identify and resolve what were previously very difficult performance problems.

![C# Programming Cookbook](/assets/img/learning/packt/csharp-programming-cookbook.png)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Dirk Strauss (valid through 9/13 at 19:00 EST). This book covers C#.
#### Publisher's Description
During your application development workflow, there is always a moment when you need to get out of a tight spot. Through a recipe-based approach, this book will help you overcome common programming problems and get your applications ready to face the modern world.

We start with C# 6, giving you hands-on experience with the new language features. Next, we work through the tasks that you perform on a daily basis such as working with strings, generics, and lots more. Gradually, we move on to more advanced topics such as the concept of object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, reactive extensions, and code contracts.

You will learn responsive high performance programming in C# and how to create applications with Azure. Next, we will review the choices available when choosing a source control solution. At the end of the book, we will show you how to create secure and robust code, and will help you ramp up your skills when using the new version of C# 6 and Visual Studio.

#### What You Will Learn

* Write better and less code to achieve the same result as in previous versions of C#.
* Generate tests from the Code Contracts for mission critical methods.
* Integrate code in Visual Studio with GitHub.
* Create a web application in Azure.
* Design and build a microservice architecture
* Demystify the Rx library using Reactive extensions
* Write high performing codes in C# and understanding multi-threading.
* Security and Debugging.
* Implement Code Contracts on code in Visual Studio.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Morgan Bruce, Paulo Pereira. This book covers Microservices.
#### Publisher's Description
Microservices in Action is a practical book about building and deploying microservice-based applications. Written for developers and architects with a solid grasp of service-oriented development, it tackles the challenge of putting microservices into production. You'll begin with an in-depth overview of microservice design principles, building on your knowledge of traditional systems. Then, you'll start creating a reliable road to production. You'll explore examples using Kubernetes, Docker, and Google Container Engine as you learn to build clusters and maintain them after deployment. Throughout this rich, experience-driven book, you'll move through real-world use cases including a continuous delivery pipeline, production monitoring, and practical techniques for scaling and maintaining a healthy system.

#### About the technology
Most enterprise developers are comfortable with writing individual components or services as part of a larger application. In microservice systems, the benefits - and unique challenges - arise from the way these services are organized, deployed, and managed. Production-ready microservice applications rely on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, container engines like Docker, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Microservices change the dev process as well, maximizing the efficiency and independence of small teams. To be successful, developers, team leaders, and architects need to master both the implementation details and the big picture of how microservices work in a production environment.

#### What's inside
* Review of microservice architecture
* Building a delivery pipeline for microservices
* Monitoring your microservices applications
* Deploying with containers
* Written by authors with daily, hands-on experience

#### About the reader
Readers should be intermediate developers with some knowledge of enterprise application architecture. Familiarity with container systems like Docker and IaaS cloud like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean is helpful but not required.

#### About the authors
Morgan Bruce and Paulo A. Pereira have years of experience building distributed applications, with particular expertise in the high-stakes finance and identity verification industries. They work daily with microservices in a production environment using the tools and techniques presented in this book.

![Functional Programming in R](/assets/img/learning/apress/functional-programming-in-r.png)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484227459) by Thomas Mailund. This book covers R.

#### Publisher's Description
Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R. In this concise book, you'll make your functions pure by avoiding side-effects; you’ll write functions that manipulate other functions, and you’ll construct complex functions using simpler functions as building blocks.

In Functional Programming in R, you’ll see how we can replace loops, which can have side-effects, with recursive functions that can more easily avoid them. In addition, the book covers why you shouldn't use recursion when loops are more efficient and how you can get the best of both worlds.

Functional programming is a style of programming, like object-oriented programming, but one that focuses on data transformations and calculations rather than objects and state. Where in object-oriented programming you model your programs by describing which states an object can be in and how methods will reveal or modify that state, in functional programming you model programs by describing how functions translate input data to output data. Functions themselves are considered to be data you can manipulate and much of the strength of functional programming comes from manipulating functions; that is, building more complex functions by combining simpler functions.

#### What You'll Learn

* Write functions in R including infix operators and replacement functions 
* Create higher order functions
* Pass functions to other functions and start using functions as data you can manipulate
* Use Filer, Map and Reduce functions to express the intent behind code clearly and safely
* Build new functions from existing functions without necessarily writing any new functions, using point-free programming
* Create functions that carry data along with them

#### Who This Book Is For
Those with at least some experience with programming in R.

The better news is that Linux skills have staying power, so what you learn about Linux now will probably still work in a decade or two. Bottom line? If you're a developer, administrator, or just a weekend hacker, you need to know your way around the Linux command line. Let's get started!

#### About the book
Linux in Action is a task-based tutorial that will give you the skills and deep understanding you'll need to administer a Linux-based system. This hands-on book guides you through real-world projects so you can practice as you learn. You'll learn critical techniques like virtualization, disaster recovery, infrastructure security, data backup, web servers, DevOps, and system troubleshooting. Plus, each chapter ends with a command-line review, list of security best practices, unfamiliar terms & definitions, and exercises to bring home the key takeaways!
