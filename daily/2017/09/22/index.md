### <a name="packt-daily"></a><small>Free</small> [Python 3 Object-oriented Programming, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) 
[![Python 3 Object-oriented Programming, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/packt/python-3-object-oriented-programming-second-edition.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Dusty Phillips (valid through 9/22 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Python 3.

#### Publisher's Description
Python 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.

Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception.

Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.

You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.

You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.

This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It’s also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.

#### What You Will Learn
* Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods
* Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface
* Extend class functionality using inheritance
* Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them
* Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python
* Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python
* Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3
* Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django.
* Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio

[![Practical Maintenance Plans in SQL Server](/assets/img/learning/apress/practical-maintenance-plans-in-sql-server.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484218945)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484218945) by Bradley Beard. This book covers SQL Server.

#### Publisher's Description
This book is a complete guide to setting up and maintaining maintenance plans for SQL Server Database Administrators. Maintenance plans too often consist of a backup task and that’s it, but there is so much more that can and must be done to ensure the integrity of your most important company resource – the data you are tasked to manage and safeguard. This book walks even the newest of users through creating a powerful, automated maintenance plan.

Automate your job using SQL Server Agent to leverage the power of Maintenance Plans to deliver real, proactive solutions to common issues. Schedule common tasks such as backups and index rebuilds to run automatically, and get early-warning notifications of impending problems relating to resource usage and query performance. By the time your boss knows to call you about a problem, you’ll have already called him to describe your solution.

The large majority of books never really cover the topic of inheriting a database server with multiple live databases; the common thread is that the databases will be created and maintained by the reader forever and ever. In the real world, that scenario rarely happens. Practical Maintenance Plans in SQL Server covers that scenario and provides you with the knowledge and tools needed to get comfortable writing your own maintenance plans for any SQL Server database, whether created by you or inherited.

* Shows the different tasks that can be run in a maintenance plan.
* Explains how and why those tasks can be implemented.
* Provides a roadmap to creating your own custom maintenance plan.

#### What You Will Learn
Implement a completely automated backup maintenance plan
Be alerted to performance problems and outages ahead of your boss
Learn the different types of database maintenance tasks
Plan the workflow of tasks within a maintenance plan
Automate your work by implementing custom maintenance plans

#### Who This Book Is For
Practical Maintenance Plans in SQL Server is for any level of database administrator, but specifically it’s for those administrators with a real need to set up a powerful maintenance plan quickly. New and seasoned administrators will appreciate the book for its robust learning pattern of visual aids in combination with explanations and scenarios. Practical Maintenance Plans in SQL Server is the perfect “new hire” gift for new database administrators in any organization.
