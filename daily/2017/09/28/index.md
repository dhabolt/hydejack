[![Machine Learning for the Web](/assets/img/learning/packt/machine-learning-for-the-web.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Andrea Isoni with foreword by Davide Cervellin (valid through 9/28 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Machine Learning, Python, Django.

#### Publisher's Description
Python is a general purpose and also a comparatively easy to learn programming language. Hence it is the language of choice for data scientists to prototype, visualize, and run data analyses on small and medium-sized data sets. This is a unique book that helps bridge the gap between machine learning and web development. It focuses on the difficulties of implementing predictive analytics in web applications. We focus on the Python language, frameworks, tools, and libraries, showing you how to build a machine learning system. You will explore the core machine learning concepts and then develop and deploy the data into a web application using the Django framework. You will also learn to carry out web, document, and server mining tasks, and build recommendation engines. Later, you will explore Python’s impressive Django framework and will find out how to build a modern simple web app with machine learning features.

#### What You Will Learn
* Get familiar with the fundamental concepts and some of the jargons used in the machine learning community
* Use tools and techniques to mine data from websites
* Grasp the core concepts of Django framework
* Get to know the most useful clustering and classification techniques and implement them in Python
* Acquire all the necessary knowledge to build a web application with Django

[![Xamarin in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/xamarin-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Jim Bennett. This book covers Xamarin, C#, IOS, Android, MVVM.

#### Publisher's Description
Xamarin is a toolset that allows you to write native mobile apps in C# and run them on both iOS and Android devices. What makes Xamarin stand out from other cross-platform tools is that it gives you the ability to share large portions of code across these two platforms while still letting you write native apps that can take full advantage of the device and OS features specific to each platform. And since Xamarin was recently acquired by Microsoft, you can be sure the ecosystem will continue to grow - Xamarin has become a hugely important part of Microsoft's "any developer, any platform" mantra.

Xamarin in Action teaches you how to build Xamarin apps on iOS and Android from scratch while maximizing code re-use. This layer-by-layer guide starts by showing you the MVVM design pattern and explaining how it increases code sharing. Next, you'll start building an app from the ground up. You'll learn all the different layers inside a well written Xamarin app and discover how most of your code can be shared between iOS and Android. You'll look at how this code sharing can be best designed to allow unit testing of your business layer as well as your UI logic. Then you'll dig in to code that can't be shared, like user interface code that's device specific. Finally, you'll learn how to take your app from final code to a tested and deployed version on the relevant store. By the end, you'll be able to build a high quality production-ready Xamarin app on iOS and Android from scratch with a high level of code reuse.

#### What's inside
* Understand MVVM and how it maximizes code reuse and testability
* Build a mobile app from rough design through final deployable product
* Creating cross platform model and UI logic layers
* Build device specific UIs for iOS and Android
* Test apps through unit and automated UI testing
* Prepare apps for publication with user tracking and crash analytics

#### About the reader
This book is for C# developers with a few months through many years of experience who want to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android using the language and toolset they already know.

#### About the author
**Jim Bennett** is a Xamarin MVP, Microsoft MVP, Xamarin Certified Developer and an active community member. He's also a frequent speaker at events all around the world, including Xamarin user groups and Xamarin and Microsoft conferences.

#### Publisher's Description
First, the statistics. According to Apple, there are currently 380,000 registered iOS developers and over a billion iOS devices in use worldwide. Swift, the language of iOS development, is the fastest growing programming language, and the App Store has taken in more than $8 billion in sales. If you're a developer, learning how to write iPhone and iPad apps in Swift is a safe bet for job security. And because mobile app development is a rapidly-changing field that combines programming, UI design, and a bit of showmanship, it's also a great bet for job satisfaction. Ready to get started?

iOS Development with Swift is a hands-on guide to creating apps for iPhone and iPad using the Swift language. You'll start by getting a birds-eye view of how an iOS application works and what it takes to build one. Then, you'll get a quick tour of Swift that highlights its similarities and differences compared to other C-style languages. With the basics well in hand, you'll work through progressively more challenging examples as you learn how to design iOS apps, build good layouts, handle navigation, and interact with the device's camera. Along the way, you'll deepen your knowledge of iOS and the Swift language through a series of tips, sidebars, and exercises.

#### What's inside
* Introduction to mobile app development for iPhone and iPad
* Adaptive designs that respond to different environments
* Storing and managing data
