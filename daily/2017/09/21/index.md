[![SFML Game Development By Example](/assets/img/learning/packt/sfml-game-development-by-example.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Raimondas Pupius (valid through 9/21 at 19:00 EST). This book covers SFML, C++.


#### Publisher's Description
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is a simple interface comprising five modules, namely, the audio, graphics, network, system, and window modules, which help to develop cross-platform media applications. By utilizing the SFML library, you are provided with the ability to craft games quickly and easily, without going through an extensive learning curve. This effectively serves as a confidence booster, as well as a way to delve into the game development process itself, before having to worry about more advanced topics such as “rendering pipelines” or “shaders.”

With just an investment of moderate C++ knowledge, this book will guide you all the way through the journey of game development.

The book starts by building a clone of the classical snake game where you will learn how to open a window and render a basic sprite, write well-structured code to implement the design of the game, and use the AABB bounding box collision concept.

The next game is a simple platformer with enemies, obstacles and a few different stages. Here, we will be creating states that will provide custom application flow and explore the most common yet often overlooked design patterns used in game development.

Last but not the least, we will create a small RPG game where we will be using common game design patterns, multiple GUI. elements, advanced graphical features, and sounds and music features. We will also be implementing networking features that will allow other players to join and play together.

By the end of the book, you will be an expert in using the SFML library to its full potential.

#### What You Will Learn
* Create and open a window by using SFML
* Utilize, manage, and apply all of the features and properties of the SFML library
* Employ some basic game development techniques to make your game tick
* Build your own code base to make your game more robust and flexible
* Apply common game development and programming patterns to solve design problems
* Handle your visual and auditory resources properly
* Construct a robust system for user input and interfacing
* Develop and provide networking capabilities to your game

#### About the Author
**Raimondas Pupius** is a game development enthusiast from Lithuania, currently working towards getting a degree in software engineering, as well as a few projects of his own. Having started his unofficial education in this field at the age of 9 and being introduced to video games even prior to that has guided him to this particular career choice, which was only strengthened by the experience earned from his first book “SFML Game Development By Example”. The ultimate dream is, of course, starting a company of his own and making professional games for a living. His other interests include web development, which was his primary interest before game development, music and linguistics.

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Peter Fisher. This book covers Docker.

#### Publisher's Description
Docker in Motion teaches you how to create and manage container-hosted applications in Docker. With over 2 hours of hands-on, practical video lessons, you'll learn the ins and outs of Docker and discover how to apply what you've learned to your own day-to-day development. Starting with an overview of Docker, you'll dive into the commands and techniques you'll need for running and managing containers, creating, modifying, saving and uploading Docker images from scratch, running and building multiple containers with Docker Compose, and more.

#### About the subject
Docker creates sandboxed environments, called containers, that isolate your applications from the underlying infrastructure, making them much easier to deploy, migrate, scale, and remove. Each Docker container includes the application and all its dependencies in a single deployable package. Docker has rapidly become a nearly universal part of IT infrastructure in millions of Linux and cloud-based deployments worldwide, including big shops like eBay and Lyft. It's time to join them!

[![Dag Prawitz on Proofs and Meaning](/assets/img/learning/springer/dag-prawitz-on-proofs-and-meaning.png)](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319110400)
[$19.99 ($120 off!) Springer eBook](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319110400) by Heinrich Wansing. This book covers Dag Prawitz, Logic, Proofs, Mathematics.

#### Publisher's Description
First volume to give a comprehensive account of Dag Prawitz's seminal contributions to proof theory and proof-theoretic semantics

Offers original, up-to-date contributions by world-wide leading experts in structural proof theory and proof-theoretic semantics

Includes topic of proofs and meaning approached from various disciplines in which logic is at home: philosophy, mathematics, and computer science

This volume is dedicated to Prof. Dag Prawitz and his outstanding contributions to philosophical and mathematical logic. Prawitz's eminent contributions to structural proof theory, or general proof theory, as he calls it, and inference-based meaning theories have been extremely influential in the development of modern proof theory and anti-realistic semantics. In particular, Prawitz is the main author on natural deduction in addition to Gerhard Gentzen, who defined natural deduction in his PhD thesis published in 1934.

The book opens with an introductory paper that surveys Prawitz's numerous contributions to proof theory and proof-theoretic semantics and puts his work into a somewhat broader perspective, both historically and systematically. Chapters include either in-depth studies of certain aspects of Dag Prawitz's work or address open research problems that are concerned with core issues in structural proof theory and range from philosophical essays to papers of a mathematical nature. Investigations into the necessity of thought and the theory of grounds and computational justifications as well as an examination of Prawitz's conception of the validity of inferences in the light of three “dogmas of proof-theoretic semantics” are included. More formal papers deal with the constructive behaviour of fragments of classical logic and fragments of the modal logic S4 among other topics.

In addition, there are chapters about inversion principles, normalization of proofs, and the notion of proof-theoretic harmony and other areas of a more mathematical persuasion. Dag Prawitz also writes a chapter in which he explains his current views on the epistemic dimension of proofs and addresses the question why some inferences succeed in conferring evidence on their conclusions when applied to premises for which one already possesses evidence.

#### About the author
**Heinrich Wansing** is a professor of logic and epistemology at the Ruhr University Bochum (Germany). He is known for his work in philosophical logic, including the semantics and proof theory of modal, constructive, paraconsistent, many-valued and other non-classical logics. Moreover, he is the editor-in-chief of the book series Trends in Logic (Springer)
