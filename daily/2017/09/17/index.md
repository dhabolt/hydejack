![ASP.NET Core in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/asp-net-core-in-action.png)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Andrew Lock. This book covers ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, ASP.NET, C#.

#### Publisher's Description
ASP.NET Core is a re-imagining of the .NET Framework that frees developers from Visual Studio and Windows. You can now build and run cross-platform .NET applications on any OS, with any IDE, and using the tools that you choose. The entire framework is open-source, and has been developed with many contributions from the community. While ASP.NET Core is relatively new, Microsoft is heavily investing in it, promoting ASP.NET Core as their web framework of choice for the foreseeable future. Whether you are building traditional web applications or highly performant APIs for client side or mobile applications, ASP.NET Core could be the framework for you.

ASP.NET Core in Action is for C# developers without any web development experience who want to get started and productive using ASP.NET Core to build web applications. In the first half of the book, you will work through the basics of a typical ASP.NET Core application, focusing on how to create basic web pages and APIs using MVC controllers and the Razor templating engine. In the second half, you will build on this core knowledge looking at more advanced requirements and how to add extra features to your application. You will learn how to secure your application behind a login screen, how to handle configuration and dependency injection, and how to deploy your application to production. In the last part of the book you will look in depth at further bending the framework to your will by creating custom components and using more advanced features of the framework.

#### What's inside
* Using MVC to deliver dynamically generated web pages
* Securing applications with login requirements
* Interacting with a RDMS using Entity Framework Core
* Publishing an ASP.NET Core application to a server
* Unit and integration testing
* Creating custom middleware and filters

#### About the reader
Readers should have experience with C#. No web development experience needed.

![Linux Hardening in Hostile Networks](/assets/img/learning/informit/linux-hardening-in-hostile-networks.jpg)
[$19.99 InformIT eBook](http://www.informit.com/deals/) by Kyle Rankin. This book covers Linux, Cyber Security.

#### Publisher's Description
**Implement Industrial-Strength Security on Any Linux Server**

In an age of mass surveillance, when advanced cyberwarfare weapons rapidly migrate into every hacker’s toolkit, you can’t rely on outdated security methods–especially if you’re responsible for Internet-facing services. In Linux® Hardening in Hostile Networks, Kyle Rankin helps you to implement modern safeguards that provide maximum impact with minimum effort and to strip away old techniques that are no longer worth your time.

Rankin provides clear, concise guidance on modern workstation, server, and network hardening, and explains how to harden specific services, such as web servers, email, DNS, and databases. Along the way, he demystifies technologies once viewed as too complex or mysterious but now essential to mainstream Linux security. He also includes a full chapter on effective incident response that both DevOps and SecOps can use to write their own incident response plan.

Each chapter begins with techniques any sysadmin can use quickly to protect against entry-level hackers and presents intermediate and advanced techniques to safeguard against sophisticated and knowledgeable attackers, perhaps even state actors. Throughout, you learn what each technique does, how it works, what it does and doesn’t protect against, and whether it would be useful in your environment.

* Apply core security techniques including 2FA and strong passwords
* Protect admin workstations via lock screens, disk encryption, BIOS passwords, and other methods
* Use the security-focused Tails distribution as a quick path to a hardened workstation
* Compartmentalize workstation tasks into VMs with varying levels of trust
* Harden servers with SSH, use apparmor and sudo to limit the damage attackers can do, and set up remote syslog servers to track their actions
* Establish secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and leverage SSH to tunnel traffic when VPNs can’t be used
* Configure a software load balancer to terminate SSL/TLS connections and initiate new ones downstream
* Set up standalone Tor services and hidden Tor services and relays
* Secure Apache and Nginx web servers, and take full advantage of HTTPS
* Perform advanced web server hardening with HTTPS forward secrecy and ModSecurity web application firewalls
* Strengthen email security with SMTP relay authentication, SMTPS, SPF records, DKIM, and DMARC
* Harden DNS servers, deter their use in DDoS attacks, and fully implement DNSSEC
* Systematically protect databases via network access control, TLS traffic encryption, and encrypted data storage
* Respond to a compromised server, collect evidence, and prevent future attacks

#### Features
* Demystifies high-security technologies like TLS, DNSSEC, and Tor, and guides readers step-by-step through implementing them
* Shows how to systematically harden Linux servers and networks against aggressive new threats
* Demonstrates today's best practices for protect email and other digital assets against intrusions from governments and sophisticated hackers
* Organizes countermeasures by complexity, so you can quickly implement easier solutions, and move on to more difficult techniques when you're ready

#### About the author
**Kyle Rankin** is an award-winning Linux Journal columnist and author of DevOps Troubleshooting and The Official Ubuntu Server Book.
