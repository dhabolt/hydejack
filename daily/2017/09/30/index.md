[![ASP.NET Core Identity Management Playbook](/assets/img/learning/pluralsight/asp-net-core-identity-management-playbook.png)](https://pluralsight.com/courses/aspnet-core-identity-management-playbook)
[ASP.NET Core Identity Management Playbook](https://pluralsight.com/courses/aspnet-core-identity-management-playbook)  by Chris Klug. This video covers ASP.NET Core 2.0.
#### Publisher's Description
ASP.NET Core 2.0 has changed the way you add authentication and authorization to your applications, and it can be a bit hard to figure out how to do it. This course, ASP.NET Core Identity Management Playbook, tries to make this easier by showing you step by step walkthroughs of how you set it up. You will learn how to set up several different kinds of authentication, ranging from local logins to Azure AD. You will also get to see how you can add authorization to your application to make sure that you not only know who the user is, but also can control what he or she is allowed to do. Finally, we will cover using social identity providers like Facebook and Twitter, and the process of letting 3rd party identity providers handle the problems involved in storing user credentials. Each module is aimed to be self contained, and show one particular thing, making it easy to figure out what parts you want to explore. By the end of this course you’ll learn everything you need to know to authenticate and authorize users for your ASP.NET Core applications.

#### About the Author
**Chris Klug** is a software developer and architect from Sweden who has spent the better part of his life solving problems by writing software. He loves the creative side of coding as well as the challenges offered by building complex UIs. He also spends a significant amount of his time presenting at developer conferences around the world--something that has apparently caught Microsoft's attention as they have awarded him Microsoft MVP for five years running. It's an award he is very proud of, and he hopes to keep being awarded if possible. But when asked, he has no problem admitting that he would rather be kite-boarding on a nice beach or having one of his tattoos extended than playing with his computer.
