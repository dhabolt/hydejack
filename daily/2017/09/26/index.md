[![Unity Virtual Reality Projects](/assets/img/learning/packt/unity-virtual-reality-projects.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Jonathan Linowes (valid through 9/26 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Virtual Reality, Unity 5, C#.

#### Publisher's Description
What is consumer “virtual reality”? Wearing a head-mounted display you view stereoscopic 3D scenes. You can look around by moving your head, and walk around using hand controls or motion sensors. You are engaged in a fully immersive experience. On the other hand, Unity is a powerful game development engine that provides a rich set of features such as visual lighting, materials, physics, audio, special effects, and animation for creating 2D and 3D games. Unity 5 has become the leading platform for building virtual reality games, applications and experiences for this new generation of consumer VR devices.

Using a practical and project-based approach, this book will educate you about the specifics of virtual reality development in Unity.

You will learn how to use Unity to develop VR applications which can be experienced with devices such as the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard. We will then learn how to engage with virtual worlds from a third person and first person character point of view. Furthermore, you will explore the technical considerations especially important and possibly unique to VR. The projects in the book will demonstrate how to build a variety of VR experiences. You will be diving into the Unity 3D game engine via the interactive Unity Editor as well as C-Sharp programming.

By the end of the book, you will be equipped to develop rich, interactive virtual reality experiences using Unity.

So, let's get to it!

#### What You Will Learn

Create 3D scenes with Unity and Blender while learning about world space and scale
Build and run VR applications for consumer headsets including Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard
Build interactive environments with physics, gravity, animations, and lighting using the Unity engine
Experiment with various user interface (UI) techniques that you can use in your VR applications

[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430263524) by Jerome Schaufeld. This book covers Commercializing Technology.

#### Publisher's Description
Commercializing Innovation: Turning Technology Breakthroughs into Products shows how to turn ideas from R&D labs, universities, patent offices, and inventors into commercially successful products and services.

Commercializing technology has never been easy, and it's getting tougher all the time. All the decisions you need to make are complicated by today's breakneck rates of change in enabling technology and by competitive pressures disseminated globally at the speed of the internet: Where to get ideas? Which to pursue? Whom to hire? Where to manufacture? How to fund? Create a startup or license to another? To answer these questions adequately and bring sophisticated products and services successfully to market, you need to deploy the systematic methods detailed in this book.

Jerry Schaufeld--serial technology entrepreneur, angel investor, and distinguished professor of entrepreneurship--presents in detail his proven step-by-step commercialization process, beginning with technology assessment and culminating with the successful launch of viable products into the global market. Using case studies, models, and practical tips culled from his entrepreneurial career, he shows readers of Commercializing Innovation how to:
* Source technology that can be turned into products
* Recognize an opportunity to create a viable product
* Perform feasibility analyses before sinking too much money into a project
* Find the right method and means to introduce the product to market
* Plan the project down to the last detail
* Execute the project in ways that improve chances of its success
* Comply with government regulation without crippling your project
* Decide whether offshore manufacturing is your best option
* Compete globally with globally sourced ideas and funding
