[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Hideto Saito, Hui-Chuan Chloe Lee, Ke-Jou Carol Hsu (valid through 9/14 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Kubernetes.

#### Publisher's Description
Kubernetes is Google’s solution to managing a cluster of containers. Kubernetes provides a declarative API to manage clusters while giving us a lot of flexibility. This book will provide you with recipes to better manage containers in different scenarios in production using Kubernetes.

We will start by giving you a quick brush up on how Kubernetes works with containers along with an overview of the main Kubernetes features such as Pods, Replication Controllers, and more. Next, we will teach you how to create Kubernetes cluster and how to run programs on Kubernetes. We’ll explain features such as High Availability Kubernetes master setup, using Kubernetes with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes using AWS. Later, will show you how to use Kubernetes-UI, and how to set up and manage Kubernetes clusters on the cloud and bare metal.

Upon completion of this book, you will be able use Kubernetes in production and will have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes.

#### What You Will Learn
* Get to know how to build your own container cluster
* Deploy and manage highly scalable applications using Kubernetes
* Discover how to build high availability Kubernetes clusters
* Find out how to build a continuous delivery pipeline for your application
* Track metrics and logs for every container running in your cluster
* Streamline the way you deploy and manage your applications with large-scale container orchestration

#### Publisher's Description
C# is an amazing language that's up to any challenge you can throw at it. As a C# developer, you also need to be up to the task. C# in Depth, Fourth Edition is your key to unlocking the powerful new features added to the language in C# 5, 6, and 7. Following the expert guidance of C# legend Jon Skeet, you'll master asynchronous functions, expression-bodied members, interpolated strings, tuples, and much more.

#### About the technology
If you're a .NET developer, you'll use C# whether you're building an advanced enterprise application or just pushing out a quick ASP.NET app. C# 5, 6 and 7 have added a host of new features to help you write better code with tuples, string interpolation, pattern matching, and more. To really succeed with these powerful new features, however, you need to learn them in depth. This book is your ticket!

#### What's inside
* The latest changes and updates for C# 5, 6, and 7
* How C# works and why
* Using asynchronous functions
* Simpler string formatting with interpolation
* Composition with tuples
* Decomposition and pattern matching

#### About the reader
If you're a C# developer who's comfortable working with the language and wants to really dig in deep, then this book is for you.

![Expert Oracle Exadata, Second Edition](/assets/img/learning/apress/expert-oracle-exadata-second-edition.png)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430262411) by Martin Bach, Kristofferson Arao, Andy Colvin, Frits Hoogland, Kerry Osborne, Randy Johnson, Tanel Poder. This book covers Oracle Exadata 5-2, Oracle Database 12c.

#### Publisher's Description
Expert Oracle Exadata, 2nd Edition opens up the internals of Oracle's Exadata platform so that you can fully benefit from the most performant and scalable database hardware appliance capable of running Oracle Database. This edition is fully-updated to cover Exadata 5-2 and Oracle Database 12c. If you're new to Exadata, you'll soon learn that it embodies a change in how you think about and manage relational databases. A key part of that change lies in the concept of offloading SQL processing to the storage layer. In addition there is Oracle's engineering effort in creating a powerful platform for both consolidation and transaction processing. The resulting value proposition in the form of Exadata has truly been a game-changer.

Expert Oracle Exadata, 2nd Edition provides a look at the internals and how the combination of hardware and software that comprise Exadata actually work. Authors include Martin Bach, Andy Colvin, and Frits Hoogland, with contributions from Karl Arao, and built on the foundation laid by Kerry Osborne, Randy Johnson, and Tanel Poder in the first edition. They share their real-world experience gained through a great many Exadata implementations, possibly more than any other group of experts today. Always their goal is toward helping you advance your career through success with Exadata in your own environment. This book is intended for readers who want to understand what makes the platform tick and for whom—"how" it does what it is does is as important as what it does. By being exposed to the features that are unique to Exadata, you will gain an understanding of the mechanics that will allow you to fully benefit from the advantages that the platform provides.

This book changes how you think about managing SQL performance and processing. It provides a roadmap to successful Exadata implementation. And it removes the "black box" mystique. You'll learn how Exadata actually works and be better able to manage your Exadata engineered systems in support of your business.

### [Python Testing with pytest](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest)
![Python Testing with pytest](/assets/img/learning/pragmatic/python-testing-with-pytest.jpg)
[Python Testing with pytest](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest) by Brian Okken. This book covers Python, pytest.

#### Publisher's Description
Do less work when testing your Python code, but be just as expressive, just as elegant, and just as readable. The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable—with no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it’s just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries. This book shows you how.

#### About this Title
For Python-based projects, pytest is the undeniable choice to test your code if you’re looking for a full-featured, API-independent, flexible, and extensible testing framework. With a full-bodied fixture model that is unmatched in any other tool, the pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting and plug-in capability—with no boilerplate code.

With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you’re testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest.

Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you’re testing and why.

#### What You Need
The examples in this book were written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.2. pytest 3.2 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3+.
