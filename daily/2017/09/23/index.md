[![Mastering Microservices with Java](/assets/img/learning/packt/mastering-microservices.with-java.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Sourabh Sharma (valid through 9/23 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Microservices, Java, Domain-Driven Design.

#### Publisher's Description
With the introduction of the cloud, enterprise application development moved from monolithic applications to small lightweight process-driven components called microservices. Microservices are the next big thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. It not only makes app development easier, but also offers great flexibility to utilize various resources optimally.

If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the microservices architecture, then this is the book for you! Starting off by understanding the core concepts and framework, you will then focus on the high-level design of large software projects. You will gradually move on to setting up the development environment and configuring it before implementing continuous integration to deploy your microservice architecture. Using Spring security, you will secure microservices and test it effectively using REST Java clients and other tools. Finally, we’ll show you the best practices and common principals of microservice design and you’ll learn to troubleshoot and debug the issues faced during development.

By the end of the book, you will know how to build smaller, lighter, and faster services that can be implemented easily in a production environment.

#### What You Will Learn
* Use domain-driven design to design and implement microservices
* Secure microservices using Spring Security
* Deploy and test microservices 
* Troubleshoot and debug the issues faced during development
* Consume microservices using a JavaScript web application
* Learning best practices and common principals about microservices

#### Publisher's Description
**WINNER of Computing Reviews 20th Annual Best Review in the category Management**

Building Great Software Engineering Teams provides engineering leaders, startup founders, and CTOs concrete, industry-proven guidance and techniques for recruiting, hiring, and managing software engineers in a fast-paced, competitive environment.

With so much at stake, the challenge of scaling up a team can be intimidating. Engineering leaders in growing companies of all sizes need to know how to find great candidates, create effective interviewing and hiring processes, bring out the best in people and their work, provide meaningful career development, learn to spot warning signs in their team, and manage their people for long-term success.

Author Josh Tyler has spent nearly a decade building teams in high-growth startups, experimenting with every aspect of the task to see what works best. He draws on this experience to outline specific, detailed solutions augmented by instructive stories from his own experience.

In this book you'll learn how to build your team, starting with your first hire and continuing through the stages of development as you manage your team for growth and success. Organized to cover each step of the process in the order you'll likely face them, and highlighted by stories of success and failure, it provides an easy-to-understand recipe for creating your high-powered engineering team.

#### Building Software from the Ground Up provides engineering leaders, startup founders, and CTOs:
* Effective techniques for finding and hiring the best engineering candidate
* The skills to manage engineers for optimum morale, performance, and career development
* Insights into the challenges you'll face as you build a team,
* Solutions to challenges richly illustrated from the author's deep and varied experience as an engineering leader

[![Google Cloud Platform in Action](/assets/img/learning/manning/google-cloud-platform-in-action-meap.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by JJ Geewax. This book covers Google Cloud Platform.

#### Publisher's Description
Cloud services make it easy to set up technical infrastructure (such as computing resources or storage capacity) without all of those pesky long-term commitments, meaning you pay for exactly what you need, and can think beyond the limits of physical machines. While there are many cloud providers to choose from, Google Cloud Platform is trusted by millions of applications and is backed by the infrastructure powering many of the services you use every day such as Google Search and YouTube. It's no wonder that people are flocking to cloud providers in general, and GCP in particular, as these unique services let you focus less on your tools and more on your application.

Google Cloud Platform in Action teaches you to build and launch applications that scale, leveraging the many services on GCP to move faster than ever. You'll begin with an introduction to what cloud services are in general and a close up look at GCP and its benefits. You'll quickly get to try it out with step-by-step instructions on deploying a basic application on GCP. Then you'll move on to more advanced topics such as how to architect your application to best take advantage of GCP services, how to launch large-scale web applications, how best to store and query huge amounts of data, and how to build the back-end of a social image sharing application. You'll also learn how to choose exactly the services that best suit your needs. By the end, you will be able to build applications that run on Google Cloud Platform and start more quickly, suffer fewer disasters, and require less maintenance.

#### What's inside
* Use Google's core infrastructure, data analytics and machine learning
* Get applications deployed quickly
* Choosing the most cost effective options
* Hands-on code examples

#### About the reader
This book is for developers who have some experience developing web applications. No experience with cloud services required.

#### About the author

#### Publisher's Description
Author Cornelia Davis likes to say that "the cloud" is more about how you design your applications than where you deploy them. Cloud Native: Designing Change-tolerant Software is your guide to developing strong applications that thrive in the dynamic, distributed, virtual world of the cloud. This book presents a mental model for cloud-native applications, along with the patterns, practices, and tooling that sets them apart. In it, you'll find realistic examples and expert advice for working with apps, data, services, routing, and more.

#### About the technology
We are amid a radical change in how we design and build applications. With cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, even small teams can take full advantage of web-scale distributed application patterns and practice. Users and customers have higher expectations for reliability, availability, and performance. Cloud-native software promises near-zero downtime, shortened feedback cycles, multi-device support, and improved cost control. All this means developers need to learn new skills and techniques, along with a new way of thinking about application design.
