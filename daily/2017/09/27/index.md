[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Matthew Poole (valid through 9/27 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Raspberry Pi.

#### Publisher's Description
This book is for all mischievous Raspberry Pi owners who’d like to see their computer transform into a neat spy gadget to be used in a series of practical pranks and projects. No previous skills are required to follow along, and if you’re completely new to Linux, you’ll pick up much of the basics for free.

We’ll help you set up your Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3 and guide you through a number of pranks and secret agent techniques that are so inconspicuous yet high on mischief. You’ll learn how to configure your operating system for maximum mischief and start exploring audio, video, or Wi-Fi techniques. We’ll show you how to record, listen, or talk to people from a distance and how to set up your own phone network. Then, you’ll plug in your webcam and set up a motion detector with an alarm and find out what the other computers on your Wi-Fi network are up to. Once you’ve mastered the techniques, we’ll combine them with a battery pack and GPS for the ultimate off-road spy kit.

#### What You Will Learn
* Install and configure the Raspbian Jessie operating system for maximum mischief
* Detect an intruder with motion detection or a laser trip wire and set off an alarm
* Listen in to conversations from a distance over Bluetooth
* Distort your voice in weird and wonderful ways
* Track the Pi's whereabouts using GPS
* Connect your Pi to the mobile Internet using a 3G dongle and make yourself anonymous on the net
* Display secret messages and codes to fellow agents on a LED display

### <a name="apress-daily"></a><small>$9.99</small> [Managing Humans, Third Edition](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221570)
[![Managing Humans, Third Edition](/assets/img/learning/apress/managing-humans-third-edition.png)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221570)
[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8423497/type/dlg/http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484221570) by Michael Lopp. This book covers Engineering Management.

#### Publisher's Description
* Lopp's hilarious stories with serious lessons extracted from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences managing humans at many of the top companies in Silicon Valley
* Third Edition of Managing Humans contains a whole new season of episodes
* Classic episodes from Rands in Repose remastered for high fidelity and freshness

Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose. The Third Edition of Managing Humans contains a whole new season of episodes from the ongoing saga of Lopp's adventures in Silicon Valley, together with classic episodes remastered for high fidelity and freshness.

Whether you're an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amid the general craziness of dysfunctional bright people caught up in the chase of riches and power. Scattered in repose among these manic misfits are managers, an even stranger breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the futures and the bank accounts of many others.

Lopp's straight-from-the-hip style is unlike that of any other writer on management and leadership. He pulls no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn't. But they are magically instructive and yield Lopp’s trenchant insights on leadership that cut to the heart of the matter—whether it's dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns, or seeing a knotty project through to completion.

Writing code is easy. Managing humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it.

#### What You'll Learn
* Lead engineers
* Handle conflict
* Hire well
* Motivate employees
* Manage your boss
* Discover how to say no
* Understand different engineering personalities
* Build effective teams
* Run a meeting well
* Scale teams

#### Who This Book Is For
Managers and would-be managers staring at the role of a manager wondering why they would ever leave the safe world of bits and bytes for the messy world of managing humans. The book covers handling conflict, managing wildly differing personality types, infusing innovation into insane product schedules, and figuring out how to build a lasting and useful engineering culture.

#### About the author

[![Programmer's Guide to Apache Thrift](/assets/img/learning/manning/programmers-guide-to-apache-thrift.png)](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Randy Abernethy. This book covers Apache Thrift.

#### Publisher's Description
Programmer's Guide to Apache Thrift provides comprehensive coverage of the Apache Thrift framework along with a developer's-eye view of modern distributed application architecture. Packed with complete code examples and pragmatic discussion, this book lays the best practices for multi-language distributed application development. You'll take a guided tour through transports, protocols, IDL and servers as you explore complete example programs in C++, Java and Python. You'll also learn how to work with platforms ranging from enterprise servers to mobile clients.

#### About the technology
Any distributed application includes individual components, often written in different languages and hosted in multiple locations, which must communicate quickly and efficiently. Apache Thrift is a communication framework that enables cross-language remote procedure calls and serialization. Apache Thrift supports embedded, mobile, web, and server environments and a host of languages ranging from JavaScript to C++. It's perfect for back end services and embedded systems where size, scalability and performance are mission critical.

#### What's inside

#### About the reader
This book assumes you're comfortable with a mainstream programming language like Java or C++ and the basics of service-oriented architecture. No experience with Apache Thrift is required.

#### About the author
**Randy Abernethy** is an active Apache Thrift contributor and can be found on the dev and user email lists. A serial entrepreneur, Randy founded Hollywood's first all hard disk recording studio in the early 90s, a direct market access institutional brokerage in the 2000s, and has recently focused on the development of proprietary automated trading systems using Apache Thrift for interoperability.
