[$9.99 Apress eBook](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484218693) by Joachim Rossberg. This book covers Agile Project Management, Team Foundation Server 2015, Visual Studio Team Services.

#### Publisher's Description
This book will help you get started with agile project management using Microsoftâ€™s latest releases of its market-leading Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015, and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The book demonstrates agile concepts and how to implement them using TFS/VSTS.

Many organizations are using agile practices today. Agility has become a key enabler for running better projects with more successful end results and high quality output. At the same time, adoption of TFS/VSTS has increased dramatically, from being just a new version control system in the very beginning to becoming the fully-featured market leader it is today.

In order to benefit the most from agile practices you need an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) toolset that supports your way of working. With TFS/VSTS, Microsoft has provided a powerful tool that is very customizable. This book shows you how you can use TFS/VSTS to implement many agile practices and how they fit into a well-thought-out ALM implementation.

The book also shows how an agile product owner can work with TFS/VSTS to setup an agile project from scratch and how to continue using TFS/VSTS throughout the whole project to track progress, create and refine the backlog, and work with Kanban and Scrum Task boards.

Keeping track of progress is important in any project. TFS/VSO includes many tools which will help you to track key metrics in an agile project. Many useful reports are available out of the box, and the TFS extensibility offers several ways to further customize reporting to fit your needs.

#### What You Will Learn:
* Agile Concepts and Processes
* How TFS/VSO supports agile processes end to end
* How you can customize TFS/VSO to better support your processes
* How to set up an agile project from scratch and manage it over its lifecycle

[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Marko LukÅ¡a. This book covers Kubernetes, Docker, Google Container Engine.

#### Publisher's Description
Monolithic applications are becoming a thing of the past as we move towards smaller, independently running microservices that can be developed, deployed, updated and scaled individually. But it can be difficult to configure, manage, and keep the whole system running properly. This is where Kubernetes comes in. Think of Kubernetes as an operating system for your cluster, making it easier to organize and schedule your application's components across a fleet of machines. With Kubernetes, you don't have to worry about which specific machine in your data center your application is running on. And even better, it provides you with primitives for health checking and replicating your application across these machines. Each layer in your application is decoupled from other layers so you can scale, update, and maintain them independently. With more and more big companies accepting the Kubernetes model as the best way to run apps, it is set to become the standard way of running distributed apps both in the cloud and local on-premises infrastructure.

#### About the book
Kubernetes in Action teaches developers how to use Kubernetes to deploy self-healing scalable distributed applications. This clearly-written guide begins by looking at the problems system administrators and software developers face when running microservice-based applications and how deploying onto Kubernetes solves them. Next, you'll get your feet wet by running your first simple containerized web application on a Kubernetes cluster running in Google Container Engine. The second part of the book explains the main concepts developers need to understand in order to run multi-component applications in Kubernetes, while the last part will explain what goes on inside Kubernetes and teach you how to tie everything you've learned in the first two parts together. By the end, you'll be able to build and deploy applications in a proper way to take full advantage of the Kubernetes platform.

#### What's inside
* Using Docker and Kubernetes
* Deploying containers by creating Pods
* Securely delivering sensitive information to containers
* Understanding Kubernetes internals
* Monitoring distributed apps
* Automatically scaling your system

#### About the reader
The book is for both application developers as well as system administrators who want to learn about Kubernetes from the developer's perspective
