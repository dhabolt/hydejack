![Practical Windows Forensics](/assets/img/learning/packt/practical-windows-forensics.jpg)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) by Ayman Shaaban, Konstantin Sapronov (valid through 9/15 at 19:00 EST). This book covers Cyber Security, Digital Forensics.

#### Publisher's Description
Over the last few years, the wave of the cybercrime has risen rapidly. We have witnessed many major attacks on the governmental, military, financial, and media sectors. Tracking all these attacks and crimes requires a deep understanding of operating system operations, how to extract evident data from digital evidence, and the best usage of the digital forensic tools and techniques. Regardless of your level of experience in the field of information security in general, this book will fully introduce you to digital forensics. It will provide you with the knowledge needed to assemble different types of evidence effectively, and walk you through the various stages of the analysis process.

We start by discussing the principles of the digital forensics process and move on to show you the approaches that are used to conduct analysis. We will then study various tools to perform live analysis, and go through different techniques to analyze volatile and non-volatile data.

#### What You Will Learn
* Perform live analysis on victim or suspect Windows systems locally or remotely
* Understand the different natures and acquisition techniques of volatile and non-volatile data.
* Create a timeline of all the system actions to restore the history of an incident.

### <small>50% off</small> [Enterprise Java Microservices](https://www.manning.com/dotd)
![Enterprise Java Microservices](/assets/img/learning/manning/enterprise-java-microservices-meap.png)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.manning.com/dotd) by Ken Finnigan. This book covers Java EE, Microservices, Netflix Hystrix, WildFly Swarm, Java.

#### Publisher's Description
This example-rich tutorial shows how to design and manage large-scale Java applications as a collection of microservices. Starting with an overview of microservices from a Java EE perspective, you'll learn how to refactor your existing applications as microservices and build microservice-based applications from scratch. You'll power through practical tutorials as you call and connect microservices, understand what load balancing is, and use Netflix Hystrix for fault tolerance. You'll also master security and testing, as well as deploying to the cloud.

#### About the technology
Over time, enterprise-grade Java applications can become giant hulking beasts of intertwined code, bloated with third-party libraries, and vulnerable to total collapse when a single part fails. It doesn't have to be that way! Microservices break down a large application into smaller components, each interacting with each other to create a united whole. As each component can start, stop, and scale independently, so the whole system benefits from better fault-tolerance and resilience. Equally-important, separating the application into smaller independent services makes it substantially easier to efficiently manage the development and incremental improvement of your system.

#### What's inside
* The microservices mental model
* Fault tolerance with Netflix Hystrix
* Securing your microservices
* Deploying to the cloud

#### About the reader
This book is for Java developers familiar with distributed n-tier application architecture.

#### About the author
Ken Finnigan has worked as an engineer and consultant for nearly 20 years. He currently co-leads the development of WildFly Swarm for Red Hat.
