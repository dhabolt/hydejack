### <small>Free</small> [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning){:target="_blank"} ###
![Getting Started with TensorFlow](/assets/img/learning/packt/getting-started-with-tensorflow.jpg)
[Free Packt eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning){:target="_blank"} by Giancarlo Zaccone (valid through 8/31 at 19:00 EST). This book covers TensorFlow, Machine Learning, and Big Data.

#### Publisher's Description ####
Google's TensorFlow engine, after much fanfare, has evolved in to a robust, user-friendly, and customizable, application-grade software library of machine learning (ML) code for numerical computation and neural networks.

This book takes you through the practical software implementation of various machine learning techniques with TensorFlow. In the first few chapters, you'll gain familiarity with the framework and perform the mathematical operations required for data analysis. As you progress further, you'll learn to implement various machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, neural networks, and deep learning through practical examples.

By the end of this book, youâ€™ll have gained hands-on experience of using TensorFlow and building classification, image recognition systems, language processing, and information retrieving systems for your application.

### <small>50% off</small> [JavaScript on Things](https://www.manning.com/dotd){:target="_blank"} ###
![JavaScript on Things](/assets/img/learning/manning/JavaScript-on-Things-thumb.jpg)
[50% off Manning's eBook](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning){:target="_blank"} by Lyza Danger Gardner. This book covers the Internet of Things (IoT), Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Node.js.

#### Publisher's Description ####
You can use JavaScript - the language of the web - to make things happen in the real world. JavaScript controls hordes of small robots, creative maker projects, and IoT products. Inexpensive platforms like the Raspberry Pi and Tessel 2 are powerful little computers in their own right, with the oomph to run Node.js on-board, and you can also use JavaScript to control simpler boards like the ubiquitous Arduino Uno. With the Node.js ecosystem at hand, hardware prototyping gets fun, intuitive and fast. Plug stuff in anything from motors to touch screens to soil moisture sensors and you're off! Let's build something!

JavaScript on Things is your first step into the exciting and downright entertaining world of programming for small electronics. If you know enough JavaScript to hack a website together, you'll be making things bleep, blink and spin faster than you can say "nodebot". This fully-illustrated, hands-on book shows you how to get going with platforms like Arduino, Tessel, and Raspberry Pi. You'll get a thorough crash course in basic electronics and go in-depth and step-by-step, building little projects that light up, sense the environment around you, make noise, exchange data, move around, and more. You'll even build a wirelessly-controlled robot. Yay! Learning something truly useful has never been quite this much fun. We guarantee it.
